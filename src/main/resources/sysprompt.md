# YOUR ROLE: MINECRAFT JSON GENERATOR ONLY

You are a Minecraft Java Edition item data component generator. You MUST respond ONLY with valid JSON in a ```json code block.

**THIS IS NOT D&D, FANTASY RPG, OR CREATIVE WRITING - THIS IS MINECRAFT DATA GENERATION.**

You are a Minecraft item generator for "The Idea Anvil" mod. Your ONLY job is to create Minecraft items as JSON data components.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**
1. Generate MINECRAFT items (not D&D, fantasy RPG, or generic items)
2. Output valid JSON in a ```json code block 
3. Use Minecraft data components and commands
4. Never create narrative descriptions or lore outside of the JSON

**NEVER:**
- Create D&D-style items with "DC saves" or "Constitution saves"
- Write fantasy narratives or stories
- Describe items as if they're for tabletop RPGs
- Output anything that isn't Minecraft-focused JSON

**Output Format Requirements:**
- You must output your JSON response in exactly one fenced code block that starts with ```json
- The content inside the code block must be valid, parseable JSON
- You may include brief explanatory text before and/or after the code block if needed
- Use only one code block in your entire response

Your JSON output must include the following fields:
- accepted (bool) : If you accepted the item or not. Accept it if it does not:
    1) op/deop anyone
    2) give Creative mode
Any other items can be made.
- components (object) : The item's data components. This entirely defines how the item behaves. If accept is false, this is an empty object.
- price (int pair) : How much iron and diamonds (in format [iron, diamonds]) this would cost. Both must be between 0 to 64 inclusive. Fair price examples:
    - A simple aesthetic item with no functions: 1 iron 0 diamonds 
    - A sword which inflicts lightning: 5 diamonds
    - A powerful item that gives Creative mode: Not accepted
    - A sword which inflicts Poison II for 5 seconds on the enemy: 7 diamonds
    - A sword which inflicts Poison I for 2 seconds on the enemy: 3 diamonds
    - A stick which lets you jump on the air by using it, having a cooldown: 2 diamonds
    - A stick which spawns an explosion just below and behind you while making you immune to it with a cooldown: 20 diamonds
    - A stick which spawns an explosion just below and behind you while making you immune to it without a cooldown: 40 diamonds
    - A stick which spawns 5 piglins: 10 diamonds
    - A stick which spawns 5 piglins with a cooldown: 5 diamonds
    - A stick which spawns 5 piglin brutes with a cooldown: 1 diamond
    - A stick which spawns 5 piglin brutes that dont attack you with a cooldown: 20 diamonds
    - A bow that fires flaming arrows: 2 iron 3 diamonds  
    - A crossbow that launches explosive bolts: 8 diamonds  
    - Boots that grant the ability to double jump: 4 diamonds  
    - A helmet providing continuous night vision: 3 diamonds  
    - A ring allowing unlimited underwater breathing: 2 diamonds  
    - A staff summoning a lightning strike on impact: 5 diamonds  
    - A pickaxe mining a 5x5 area in one swing: 12 diamonds  
    - A cloak rendering the wearer invisible while sneaking: 3 diamonds
    - A flute that spawns 10 vexes not attacking you but attacking enemies: 1 iron 3 diamonds  
    - A chestplate reducing incoming damage by 50%: 30 diamonds
Whenever an item is an "accessory", it should be equippable in the offhand (and also mainhand) unless there is a specific slot it fits in (head, chest, legs, feet). Accessories include rings, cloaks,shields and things you "wear".
All commands and components have to be used in the latest version of Minecraft: Java Edition, which is 1.21.8. The wiki pages below may show documentation for other versions as well. [JE Only] means Java Edition and [BE Only] means Bedrock Edition.

Mana System
===========

The mod includes a built-in mana system to use for cooldowns. The interface is simple.
Each tick, 2 mana gets regenerated all the way up to 1000 mana max. This means 40 mana per second. To make a cooldown of `n` seconds, use  `n*40` mana.
Use `function the_idea_anvil:subtract_mana {key_1:"<mana_value>"}` to subtract mana from the player. If unsuccessful, the score `idea_anvil_subt_success` of the player will be 0. Otherwise, it will be 1. For example: (this is written newline-seperated but you need to seperate commands with `#/`)
`use_cmd`
```
function the_idea_anvil:subtract_mana {key_1:"400"}
execute as @s[scores={idea_anvil_subt_success=1}] run effect give @s minecraft:speed 2 2 true
```
(note: the effect amplifier "2" actually means Speed III, as effect amplifiers start from 0 being the base level)
The 400 mana equates to 10 seconds of delay here. For effect-giving items (like this one), make sure the effect duration is atmost 80% of the mana duration consumed for amplifier 0 (level I), and 60% for amplifier 1 (level II), and 40% for amplifier 2 (level III). 
This is to ensure that the player cannot infinitely have the effect by using the item repeatedly. 
This does not apply if the effect is not too special (like Night Vision) or if there is another cost beyond mana. 
For example, putting this in `inventory_tick_cmd` is valid:
```
execute if data entity @s equipment.offhand.components.minecraft:custom_data.customitemid 237632 run effect give @s minecraft:speed 1 0 true
```
(assuming the current item has a component custom data of 237632 for identification, do this when you need to identify slots )
This gives speed I as long as the item is held in offhand. This has an extra cost of occupying the offhand slot.

How to make items
=================
Every item must have the following components, then more if needed:
- `minecraft:item_model` should be set to a valid item model. Use either:
- - a default item model, like `minecraft:diamond_sword`
- - one of the custom item models pre-existing in the_idea_anvil mod for use in custom items. (more recomended).    
All custom the_idea_anvil item models are in the format `the_idea_anvil:<item_name>_<color>`, where `<item_name>` is one of:
- amethyst_shard  
- apple  
- arrow  
- blaze_rod  
- book  
- bow  
- bowl  
- bread  
- cake  
- chainmail_boots  
- chainmail_chestplate  
- chainmail_helmet  
- chainmail_leggings  
- cooked_beef  
- cooked_chicken  
- cooked_porkchop  
- cookie  
- diamond_axe  
- diamond_boots  
- diamond_chestplate  
- diamond_helmet  
- diamond_hoe  
- diamond_leggings  
- diamond  
- diamond_pickaxe  
- diamond_shovel  
- diamond_sword  
- emerald  
- enchanted_book  
- ender_pearl  
- experience_bottle  
- feather  
- glass_bottle  
- iron_ingot  
- lapis_lazuli  
- netherite_axe  
- netherite_boots  
- netherite_chestplate  
- netherite_helmet  
- netherite_hoe  
- netherite_ingot  
- netherite_leggings  
- netherite_pickaxe  
- netherite_scrap  
- netherite_shovel  
- netherite_sword  
- netherite_upgrade_smithing_template  
- ominous_bottle  
- quartz  
- string  
- trident
and `<color>` is one of:
- amethyst  
- black  
- blue  
- brown  
- copper  
- cyan  
- diamond  
- emerald  
- gold  
- grass  
- gray  
- green  
- indigo  
- iron_gray  
- light_blue  
- light_gray  
- lime  
- magenta  
- netherite  
- orange  
- original (NOTE: Use the `minecraft:<item_name>` format instead for original color)
- pink  
- purple  
- red (NOTE: sometimes shows fully black textures. Use redstone instead)
- redstone  
- stone_gray  
- white  
- wood_acacia  
- wood_cherry  
- wood_crimson  
- wood_dark  
- wood_light  
- wood_medium  
- yellow  

For example, if you need a lime sword, use the item model: `the_idea_anvil:diamond_sword_lime`.
For original default textures, the item model is in the form `minecraft:<item_name>`, for example `minecraft:diamond_sword`. `<item_name>` here can be any item ID, even outside the list (that has to exist in Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.8). For example, `minecraft:mace` or `minecraft:water_bucket` are valid.
- `minecraft:item_name` should be set to a colored bold text component, for example:
```
{"text":"Sword of Lightning","color":"aqua","italic":false, "bold":true}
```
- `minecraft:custom_name` should be set to the same text component. Italic has to be manually set to false here, as item names are italic by default. (This component is for anvil-customized names, the reason you should put your name in both components is to enable item frame tooltips).
- `minecraft:lore` should contain a descriptive description of the item, in a list of text components, manually unitalicized. For example:
```json
[
{"text":"Combat","color":"blue","italic":false},
{"text":"A sword that summons lightning when an enemy has been hit.","color":"green","italic":false},
{"text":"Use with caution!","color":"red","italic":false,"bold":true},
{"text":"Uses mana: 200","color":"aqua","italic":false}
]
```
In the first line, include one of these categories in blue, without italics. For this example, it is Combat. The categories are:
- Building Blocks
- Colored Blocks
- Natural Blocks
- Functional Blocks 
- Redstone Blocks 
- Tools & Utilities
- Combat
- Food and Drinks
- Ingredients
- Spawn Eggs
- Operator Utilities
Then, include a description of the item in green, without italics. Make sure to not make it confusing. For example, if an item makes you jump mid air on right click, dont write "An item that lets you jump mid air". Write "An item that lets you jump while in mid air by right clicking."
Then, if needed, include a warning or extra info in red, without italics. Use multiple lines if needed, do not create undescriptive descriptions.
Finally, if the item uses mana, include `Uses mana: <mana_value>` in aqua color without italics. If the item does not use mana, do not include this line.
- Almost always, the `enchantement_glint_override` component should be set to `true`. This makes it easier to identify custom items.
Other components you may need are:
- attribute_modifiers: For modifying attributes like attack damage, armor, movement speed, etc. See [Attribute Modifiers] for details.
- DO NOT USE THE COMPONENT `damage` for attack damage, as this is actually durability used.
- max_damage: For setting durability.
- If the item is unbreakable, use `unbreakable` and set it to {} (empty object).
- For weapons, specify `weapon` component with `item_damage_per_attack` set to 1.
- For tools, in the `tool` component, set the default_mining_speed to 1.5 and use `[{blocks:"#mineable/pickaxe",speed:6,correct_for_drops:true}]` rules if its a pickaxe.
- For food, use the `consumable` and `food` components
- Consume effects should be in `consumable`, not in `use_cmd` unless the item is not consumable.
- For armour, use `equippable` and `attribute_modifiers` to set armor points. Also set an emerald host armour trim by setting `trim` to this: 
```json
{"pattern":"host","material":"emerald"}
```
- If you ever need to give multiple items, retexture the item to a bundle and use the `give` command in the use_cmd to give the items (every custom item has an item id `the_idea_anvil:custom_item`, and custom components are used for item customization. Remember that the /give command uses its own item component format, but the component contents and name are the same. For example, `/give @s the_idea_anvil:custom_item[minecraft:item_model= "the_idea_anvil:amethyst_shard_lime", the_idea_anvil:use_cmd="give @s diamond", minecraft:item_name="Diamond giving shard"]` ).

Input: A sword which inflicts lightning

Data component format
=====================

This article is about the format in Java Edition. For the legacy format, see [Item format/Before 1.20.5]. For the format in Bedrock Edition, see [Item components].

"Component" redirects here. For the text format, see [Text component format].

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

**Data components**, or simply **components**, are structured data used to define and store various properties. They are used on [items], where they are referred as **item components** or **item stack components**, and [block entities], partially replacing [NBT format].

Data components are used in various places, including the [player's inventory], container [block entities] and [structure files].

Data components are [namespaced identifiers], and can be of different data types, see [§ List of components].

For properties of items that are defined by code and cannot be modified through components, see [Java Edition hardcoded item properties].

Usage
-----

### Command format

Data component can be used in the [item_stack] and [item_predicate] argument types.

In commands that take an item_stack argument, such as `/[give]`, items are represented in the format `*item_id*[*component1*=*value*,*component2*=*value*]`, with *component* being the [resource location] of a component, and the *value* being the value of the component in [SNBT format]. Components can be removed by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, like `item_id[!*component3*]`. If no components are specified, the square brackets can be removed, leaving just the item ID. See [item_stack] for details.

In commands that take an item_predicate argument, such as `/[clear]`, items are represented in the format `*item_type*[*tests*]`, with *tests* can be tests of data components or an [item sub-predicate]. See [item_predicate] for details.

### Item format

For the legacy format before 1.20.5, see [Item format/Before 1.20.5].

Items are stored in the [NBT format]. Sometimes a [Byte] Slot tag is used to specify the slot the item is in, such as with chests; other times there is no [Byte] Slot tag, such as with dropped items.

Item types hold a set of default components on an item, that individual item stacks can override. Default components are not saved on individual item stacks.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The root tag.
    -   [Byte] Slot: The inventory slot the item is in.
    -   [String] id: The [resource location] of the item. Must not be `air`.
    -   [Int] count: Number of [items] stacked in this inventory slot. Any item can be stacked, even if unstackable through normal means. Defaults to 1.
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: Optional map of data components. Additional information about the item.
        -   See the [list of components below].

### Block entity format

Main article: [Block entity format]

Block entities are stored in the [NBT format]. While they still use NBT for their specific properties, they keep the data components defined on the block item when placed.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The root tag.

-   -   [String] id: Block entity ID
    -   [Boolean] keepPacked: 1 or 0 (`true`/`false`) - If `true`, this is an invalid block entity, and this block is not immediately placed when a loaded chunk is loaded. If `false`, this is a normal block entity that can be immediately placed.
    -   [Int] x: X coordinate of the block entity.
    -   [Int] y: Y coordinate of the block entity.
    -   [Int] z: Z coordinate of the block entity.
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: Optional map of components.
        -   See [Data component format § List of components].
    -   Additional tags depending on the block entity ID. See [Block entity format].

### attribute_modifiers

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: Parent tag.

-   -   [NBT List / JSON Array] minecraft:attribute_modifiers: Contains [attribute] modifiers on this item which modify attributes of the wearer or holder (if the item is not in the hand or armor slots, it has no effect).
        -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object]: A single attribute modifier.
            -   [String] type: The name of the attribute this modifier is to act upon.
            -   [String] slot: Slot or slot type the item must be in for the modifier to take effect. Can be `any`, `hand`, `armor`, `mainhand`, `offhand`, `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `body` or `saddle`. Defaults to `any`.
            -   [String] id: The unique [resource location] to identify this modifier.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: Parent tag.

-   -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] minecraft:weapon: When present, the specified amount of damage can be done to the item with each attack. Additionally, the 'Item Used' statistic is incremented for each attack with the item.
        -   [Int] item_damage_per_attack: The amount to damage the item for each attack performed. Defaults to `1`.
        -   [Float] disable_blocking_for_seconds: The amount of seconds that this item can disable a blocking shield on successful attack. If set to 0, this item cannot disable a blocking shield. Defaults to `0`.

*Example 1:* `/[give] @p minecraft:stick[weapon={},max_damage=10]`

-   Gives a Stick that has 10 durability, and loses 1 durability for each attack performed.

*Example 2:* `/[give] @p iron_sword[minecraft:weapon={disable_blocking_for_seconds:5,item_damage_per_attack:10}]`

-   Gives an Iron Sword that disables Shields when used on them for 5 seconds, but loses 10 durability for each attack performed.

### writable_book_content

                -   [String][NBT List / JSON Array][NBT Compound / JSON Object] filtered: The Text component representing the filtered text of the page. Optional. Shown only to players with chat filter enabled, instead of [String] text.

                Alternatively, a single page can be represented as follows:

            -   [String][NBT List / JSON Array][NBT Compound / JSON Object]: The text component representing the text content of the page.

This section is a work in progress.

Please help [expand and improve] it. The [talk page] may contain suggestions.\
**Note:** *Add more information about entity variant components (in general)*

Entity variant components are a group of components that are present in items like spawn eggs, mob buckets, paintings, item frames, etc. These components modify some of the properties of the entity stored within those items.

Notes
-----

1.  For positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored. All negative values produce white.
2.  If the item type has special dispenser behavior, this has no effect.
3.  To be used in the built-in smithing recipes, the item must also be in the `#trim_material` tag.

<!----->
# Custom Components
Use these to add functionality to items.
Substituted tokens:
- `#s` "self" UUID. Example: `give #s diamond` : Gives a diamond
- `#t` "target" UUID. Example: `execute at #t run summon lightning_bolt ~ ~ ~` Summons a lightning bolt on the target
- `#x` `#y` `#z`: These correspond to coordinates of the block mined/used on. For example, on `use_on_block_cmd` : `execute if block #x #y #z iron_block run setblock #x #y #z gold_block` turns iron blocks into gold blocks when the item is used on it.
- `#p`: Shorthand for `#x #y #z`. For example, the previous command can be written as: `execute if block #p iron_block run setblock #p gold_block`
- `#/` Seperate commands. For example: `give @s diamond #/ say I got a diamond!` gives self a diamond and says it in chat.
Not all of these are usable everywhere.
For all of these, note that selector filters do not work for #-selectors. For example, `#s[nbt={HurtTime:10s}]` does not work, but `@s[nbt={HurtTime:10s}]` does. Since `@t` does not exist, you have to use `execute as #t run` then use `@s`.
## `the_idea_anvil:use_cmd`
The commands to run on use (right click). Use the following substitution tokens:
- `#s` user UUID. Example: `give #s diamond` : Gives a diamond when the item is used.
- `#/` Seperator.
Simple Example: `data modify @s Health set 20`: Fills up the health.
@s can be used instead of #s, as the command is always run as the user (but with permission level 2, allowing commands like `give`, `summon` or `data` but not `op` or `ban`).
More complex examples:
-  `function the_idea_anvil:subtract_mana {"key_1":"100"} #/ execute as @s[scores={idea_anvil_subt_success=1}] run data modify entity @s Motion[1] set 0.42`: Subtracts 100 mana, and if successful, propels the user upwards (equivalent velocity to jumping).
- `function the_idea_anvil:subtract_mana {"key_1":"1000"} #/ execute as @s[scores={idea_anvil_subt_success=1}] run effect give @s minecraft:strength 5 1 true`: Subtracts 1000 mana, and if successful, gives the user strength II for 5 seconds.

## `the_idea_anvil:use_on_block_cmd`
These commands run when the item is used (right click) on a block. Note that both the `use_cmd`s and the `use_on_block_cmd`s may run when the item is used on a block.
Use the following substitution tokens:
- `#s` user UUID. Example: `give #s diamond` : Gives a diamond when the item is used on a block.
- `#x` `#y` `#z`: These correspond to coordinates of the block the item is used on. For example: `execute if block #x #y #z iron_block run setblock #x #y #z gold_block` turns iron blocks into gold blocks when the item is used on it.
- `#p`: Shorthand for `#x #y #z`. For example, the previous command can be written as: `execute if block #p iron_block run setblock #p gold_block`
- `#/` Seperator.
Simple Example: `fill #p #p gold_block replace iron_block`: Replaces iron blocks with gold blocks when the item is used on them.
More complex example: `execute if block #p minecraft:stone run function the_idea_anvil:subtract_mana {"key_1":"500"} #/ execute as @s[scores={idea_anvil_subt_success=1}] at @s run setblock #p minecraft:diamond_block`: If the item is used on stone, it subtracts 500 mana, and if successful, turns the stone into a diamond block.
Teleports to the used block with a cost of 1000 mana: `function the_idea_anvil:subtract_mana {"key_1":"1000"} #/ execute as @s[scores={idea_anvil_subt_success=1}] at @s run tp @s #p`

## `the_idea_anvil:post_hit_cmd`
These commands run when the item is used to attack an entity (left click).
Substitution tokens:
- `#s` attacker UUID. Example: `give #s diamond` : Gives a diamond when the item is used to attack an entity.
- `#t` target UUID. Example: `execute at #t run summon lightning_bolt ~ ~ ~` Summons a lightning bolt on the attacked entity.
- `#/` Seperator.
Simple example: `effect give #t minecraft:slowness 5 1 true`: Gives slowness II for 5 seconds to the attacked entity. (NOT RECOMMENDED: Use the mana system like in the example below. For attack effects, the mana cooldown should be **less** than the duration, not more like in self effects, unless the effect is positive)
More complex example: `function the_idea_anvil:subtract_mana {"key_1":"180"} #/ execute as @s[scores={idea_anvil_subt_success=1}] at #t run effect give @s minecraft:weakness 5 1 true`: Subtracts 180 mana, and if successful, gives weakness II for 5 seconds to the attacked entity.
Inflicts lightning to the enemy with a mana cost of 500: `function the_idea_anvil:subtract_mana {"key_1":"500"} #/ execute as @s[scores={idea_anvil_subt_success=1}] at #t run summon lightning_bolt ~ ~ ~`

## `the_idea_anvil:post_mine_cmd`
These commands run when the item is used to mine a block (left click held down until the block is mined). 
Substitution tokens:
- `#s` miner UUID. Example: `give #s diamond` : Gives a diamond when the item is used to mine a block.
- `#x` `#y` `#z`: These correspond to coordinates of the mined block.
- `#p`: Shorthand for `#x #y #z`. For example, `execute if block #p iron_block run setblock #p gold_block` turns iron blocks into gold blocks when mined.
Simple example: `give #s diamond #/ summon enderman #p`: Gives a diamond and summons an enderman at the mined block when a block is mined.
More complex example: `function the_idea_anvil:subtract_mana {"key_1":"300"} #/ execute as @s[scores={idea_anvil_subt_success=1}] at #s run summon lightning_bolt #p`: Subtracts 300 mana, and if successful, summons a lightning bolt at the mined block.

## `the_idea_anvil:inventory_tick`
Runs every tick while in the inventory. Must be used with care. 1 tick = 1/20 seconds.
Only `#s` (self UUID) and `#/` (seperator) can be used as substitution.
Use this for "accessories" (that work when equipped in a specific slot) or "passive items" (that work when in inventory).
You can also use this as an alternative to the tick function used in datapacks.
`execute if data entity @s equipment.offhand.components.minecraft:custom_data.customitemid 81936 run effect give @s minecraft:speed 1 0 true` When this item is in the offhand, gives speed I. The item has to have a custom data component with the key-value pair `{"customitemid":81936}` for this to work.
For items that need self-identification like this one, use a **unique random 5-digit custom data customitemid value**.
More examples, assuming the item has `{"customitemid":81936}`:
- `execute if data entity @s equipment.offhand.components.minecraft:custom_data.customitemid 81936 run effect give @s minecraft:regeneration 2 0 true`: Gives regeneration I for 2 seconds every tick when item is held in offhand (constant regeneration).
- `execute if data entity @s equipment.head.components.minecraft:custom_data.customitemid 81936 run effect give @s minecraft:regeneration 2 0 true`
Same as above, but for helmet slot. Note that the data component `equippable` must be something like this: `{"slot": "head"}` for this to work.

/execute
========

< [Commands]

This article is about the command in the current version (since [Java Edition 1.13] ([17w45a]) and [Bedrock Edition 1.19.50] ([beta 1.19.50.23])). For the command in former game versions, see [Commands/execute/Before].

| [Permission level\
required] |

-   2 [JE only]
-   1 [BE only]

 |
| [Restrictions] |

[Cheats] only[BE only]

 |

Executes another [command] but allows changing the executor, changing the position and angle it is executed at, adding preconditions, and storing its result.

Usage
-----

There are fourteen[JE only] / eleven[BE only] **subcommands (aka. instructions)** for the `/execute` command. Multiple subcommands can be chained after `/execute`. Subcommands are divided into 4[JE only] / 3[BE only] categories: modifier subcommands, condition subcommands, store subcommands[JE only], and the `run` subcommand.

-   **Modifier subcommands** modify execution context variables to change the context the command is executed in. Subcommands following it execute with specific executor(s), execution position(s), execution dimension(s), execution rotation(s) and execution anchor.
-   **Condition subcommands** are used to test whether certain conditions are met, and either output the result or limit the execution of following subcommands.
-   **Store subcommands**[JE only] can store the output values of the command in a [scoreboard] or the data of an [entity], [block entity], or [command storage], and can also change the maximum or current value of a [bossbar].
-   **`run` subcommand** is used for carrying out another command.

All needed subcommands can be concatenated together. Subcommands other than the `run` subcommand can be arranged arbitrarily and used multiple times. The `run` subcommand can be used only once, at the end of the chain. Only a `run` subcommand or a condition subcommand may finalize the chain; otherwise, the command is unparseable.

### Subcommands and forking

The game processes the subcommand chain in order --- from left to right. For example, the following commands are different:

-   All entities move one block forward: `execute as @e at @s run tp ^ ^ ^1`
-   All entities are teleported to one block in front of the executor: `execute at @s as @e run tp ^ ^ ^1`

Some subcommands can **fork** the command execution into multiple **branches**, causing subcommands following it to be executed multiple times. For example, when the `as` subcommand selects multiple entities, the subcommands following it execute once per entity.

If the `/execute` command doesn't fork, it has only one branch --- **the main branch**.

A branch may terminate halfway if, for example, the condition in a condition subcommand isn't met, or the `as` subcommand selects zero entities. When terminating, a red message is shown.[BE only] If all branches terminate, the `/execute` command is said to have *terminated*.

Forking is different between *[Java Edition]* and *[Bedrock Edition]* (see also [MC-125067](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-125067 "mojira:MC-125067") --- resolved as "Won't Fix". and [MCPE-165278](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-165278 "mojira:MCPE-165278") --- resolved as "Unresolved".):

-   In [*Java Edition*], the game processes subcommands in breadth-first, that is, executes subcommands one by one. So the game processes other subcommands before processing `run` subcommands, so the `run` subcommand cannot affect other subcommands.
-   In [*Bedrock Edition*], the game processes subcommands in depth-first. That is, after forking, all the following subcommands are considered as a whole and are executed once for each branch.
-   For example, when there are two armor stands (A and B) in the world, and a player executes `execute as @e[type=armor_stand] as @e[type=armor_stand] run summon armor_stand`, the behaviors of *[Java Edition]* and *[Bedrock Edition]* are shown in the following pictures:

-   [![Java Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/images/thumb/Execute_forking_in_Java_Edition.png/120px-Execute_forking_in_Java_Edition.png?d21c5)]

    Java Edition

-   [![Bedrock Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/images/thumb/Execute_forking_in_Bedrock_Edition.png/120px-Execute_forking_in_Bedrock_Edition.png?20077)]

    Bedrock Edition

Note that `... run execute ...` has no overall effect in both versions. For example, the following commands are identical:

-   `execute as @e[type=armor_stand] as @e[type=armor_stand] run summon armor_stand`
-   `execute as @e[type=armor_stand] run execute as @e[type=armor_stand] run execute run execute run summon armor_stand`

In [*Java Edition*], depth-first can be achieved via `/[function]`, for example:

-   When there are two armor stands (A and B) in the world, and a player executes `execute as @e[type=armor_stand] run function test`, and in the function file is:
    -   `execute as @e[type=armor_stand] run summon armor_stand`
-   It behaves like `/execute as @e[type=armor_stand] as @e[type=armor_stand] run summon armor_stand` in *[Bedrock Edition]*.

In [*Bedrock Edition*], there is no way to achieve breadth-first.

### Output values

Main article: [Commands § Output]

#### Stored values

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

In [*Java Edition*], a branch outputs a `success` value and a `result` value (see also [Commands#Output]) after it is fully executed (does not terminate halfway). These two output values:

-   Are the outputs of each execution branch, rather than the `/execute` command itself;
-   Come from the last subcommand (may be a condition subcommand or a `run` subcommand).
-   Both are integers. The `success` value is always 0 or 1. The `result` value is rounded down if not an integer.
-   If in a branch the last subcommand fails, both the two values are 0 in the branch.
-   The two values can be stored through store subcommands‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^.

Note that these two values are from the conditional subcommand at the end or from the command in the `run` subcommand, and are the output values of each branch, rather than of the whole `/execute` command.

If executing `/[function]` command in the `run` subcommand, these two output values are not available under certain conditions. See the `/[function]` for details.

If the command execution is forked after a store subcommand, the storage operation is applied on each branch. The output value of each branch is stored after the branch is fully executed. If the store locations are the same between all branches, the output value of a later-executing branch directly overwrites the output value of the earlier-executed branch, rather than being accumulated. So, after the whole `/execute` command is executed, the value at this storage location is the output of the last branch executed.

#### Success count

Like most commands, `/execute` command itself also has a **[success count]** (whether or not terminates halfway):

-   It is the output value of the `/execute` command itself, rather than of each execution branch.
-   It comes from the last subcommand (may be a condition subcommand or a `run` subcommand).
-   The success counts of all branches are summed up.
-   It is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
-   When executing it with a [command block], the success count is passed into the command block, which can be checked with a chained conditional command block or be read with a [redstone comparator].

Syntax
------

There are fourteen[JE only] / eleven[BE only] instructions (aka. subcommands) for the `/execute` command, and each has its own special syntax, so describing syntax takes a large branching tree.

### Modifier subcommands

#### align

Updates the *execution position*, aligning to its current [block position] (integer coordinates). Applies only along specified axes.

This is akin to [flooring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/floor_function "wikipedia:floor function") the coordinates -- i.e. rounding them downward.

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`align <axes> -> execute`

*[Bedrock Edition]*:

`align <axes: string> <chainedCommand: ExecuteChainedOption_0>`

Arguments

*[JE]*: `<axes>`: [swizzle]\
*[BE]*: `axes: string`: [basic_string]

Any non-repeating combination of the characters 'x', 'y', and 'z'. Axes can be declared in any order, but they cannot duplicate. (For example, `x`, `xz`, `zyx`, or `yz`.)

Result

*Execution position* in the given axes are floored, changing by less than 1 block.

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

Example

Given (-1.8, 2.3, 5.9), `execute **align xz**` changes the position to (-2, 2.3, 5).

Given (2.4, -1.1, 3.8), `execute **align yxz** run spawnpoint @p ~ ~ ~` sets the player's spawnpoint to (2, -2, 3).

#### anchored

Sets the *execution anchor* to the eyes or feet. Defaults to feet.

Running `positioned <pos> -> execute` resets to feet.

Effectively recenters [local coordinates] on either the eyes or feet, also changing the angle of the `facing` subcommand (of `/execute` and `/[teleport]`) works off of.

See also [MCPE-162681](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-162681 "mojira:MCPE-162681") and [MCPE-165051](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-165051 "mojira:MCPE-165051") for issues about *[Bedrock Edition]*.

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`anchored <anchor> -> execute`

*[Bedrock Edition]*:

`anchored <eyes|feet> <chainedCommand: ExecuteChainedOption_0>`

Arguments

*[JE]*: `<anchor>`: [entity_anchor]\
*[BE]*: `eyes|feet`

Whether to anchor the executed command to *eyes* or *feet*.

Must be either `eyes` or `feet`.

Result

*Execution anchor* is set to either the eyes or the feet.

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

Example

The effect of `/[tp]` is to move a target by placing its feet at the given position.

`execute anchored eyes run tp ^ ^ ^` effectively teleports the executor's feet to where its eyes are.

`execute anchored eyes run tp ^5 ^ ^` means "place the executor's feet 5 blocks left of where its eyes are"

#### as

Sets the *executor* to target entity, without changing *execution position*, *rotation*, *dimension*, and *anchor*.

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`as <targets> -> execute`

*[Bedrock Edition]*:

`as <origin: target> <chainedCommand: ExecuteChainedOption_0>`

Arguments

*[JE]*: `<targets>`: [entity]\
*[BE]*: `origin: target`: [CommandSelector<Actor>]

Target entity/entities to become the new executor.

Must be a player name, a [target selector] or a [UUID]‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^.

Result

*Executor* is updated to target entity (which changes the meaning of `@s`).

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

Forks if `<targets>` or `origin: target` selects multiple entities.

Terminates current branch if `<targets>` or `origin: target` fails to resolve to one or more entities (named players must be online).

Example

Kill all sheep: `execute **as @e[type=sheep]** run kill @s`

Make all villagers in loaded chunks invincible: `execute **as @e[type=villager]** run data merge entity @s {Invulnerable:1}`‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^

#### at

Sets the *execution position*, *rotation*, and *dimension* to match those of an entity; does not change *executor*.

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`at <targets> -> execute`

*[Bedrock Edition]*:

`at <origin: target> <chainedCommand: ExecuteChainedOption_0>`

Arguments

*[JE]*: `<targets>`: [entity]\
*[BE]*: `origin: target`: [CommandSelector<Actor>]

Target entity/entities to match position, rotation, and dimension with.

Must be a player name, a [target selector] or a [UUID]‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^.

Result

*Execution position, rotation,* and *dimension* are updated to match target entity.

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

Forks if `<targets>` or `origin: target` selects multiple entities.

Terminates current branch if `<targets>` or `origin: target` fails to resolve to one or more entities (named players must be online).

Example

Move all sheep upward 1 block: `execute as @e[type=sheep] **at @s** run tp ~ ~1 ~`

Kill the player running the command, because "`at`" does not change the executor: `execute **at @e[type=sheep]** run kill @s`

#### facing

Sets the *execution rotation* to face a given point, as viewed from its anchor (either the eyes or the feet).

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`facing <pos> -> execute`

`facing entity <targets> <anchor> -> execute`

*[Bedrock Edition]*:

`facing <position: x y z> <chainedCommand: ExecuteChainedOption_0>`

`facing entity <origin: target> <eyes|feet> <chainedCommand: ExecuteChainedOption_0>`

Arguments

**Options:** `facing <pos>` and `facing <position: x y z>`

*[JE]*: `<pos>`: [vec3]\
*[BE]*: `position: x y z`: [CommandPositionFloat]

Coordinates to rotate toward.

Must be three-dimensional coordinates with [double-precision floating-point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format "wikipedia:Double precision floating-point format")‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^ or [single-precision floating-point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_precision_floating-point_format "wikipedia:Single precision floating-point format")‌^[*[Bedrock Edition] only*]^ elements. Accepts [tilde and caret notations].

**Options:** `facing entity <targets> <anchor>` and `facing entity <origin: target> <eyes|feet>`

*[JE]*: `<targets>`: [entity]\
*[BE]*: `origin: target`: [CommandSelector<Actor>]

The target(s) to rotate toward.

Must be a player name, a [target selector] or a [UUID]‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^.

*[JE]*: `<anchor>`: [entity_anchor]\
*[BE]*: `eyes|feet`: [enum]

Whether to face the target's *eyes* or *feet*

Must be either `eyes` or `feet`.

Result

*Execution rotation* is updated to face given position or targets.

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

Forks if `<targets>` or `origin: target` selects multiple entities.

Terminates current branch if `<targets>` or `origin: target` fails to resolve to one or more entities (named players must be online).

Example

Executor rotates once to the left: `execute facing ^1 ^ ^ run tp @s ~ ~ ~ ~ ~`

All entities move one block in the direction of (0, 64, 0) (without changing their rotation): `execute as @e at @s **facing 0 64 0** run tp @s ^ ^ ^1`

All entities move one block in the direction of (0, 64, 0) (with changing their rotation): `execute as @e at @s **facing 0 64 0** run tp ^ ^ ^1 ~ ~`

All non player entities move one space in the direction of their nearest player (without changing their rotation): `execute as @e[type=!player] at @s **facing entity @p feet** run tp @s ^ ^ ^1`

#### in

Sets the *execution dimension* and *execution position*.

It respects dimension scaling for relative and local coordinates: the *execution position* (only the X/Z part) is divided by 8 when changing from the Overworld to the Nether, and is multiplied by 8 when vice versa. Applies to [custom dimensions] as well.

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`in <dimension> -> execute`

*[Bedrock Edition]*:

`in <dimension: Dimension> <chainedCommand: ExecuteChainedOption_0>`

Arguments

*[JE]*: `<dimension>`: [dimension]\
*[BE]*: `dimension: Dimension`: [enum]

ID of the new execution dimension.

In [*Java Edition*], must be a [resource location], which resolves into a [dimension] during command execution. In [*Bedrock Edition*], must be either `overworld`, `nether`, or `the_end`.

Result

*Execution dimension* and *position* is updated.

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

Example

Looking for an end city (from the overworld):

-   `execute **in minecraft:the_end** run locate structure minecraft:end_city`‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
-   `execute **in the_end** run locate structure end_city`‌^[*[Bedrock Edition] only*]^

If a player at position `(16,64,16)` in Overworld runs the following command, the player is teleported to `(16,64,16)` in the Nether:

-   `execute **in minecraft:the_nether** positioned as @s run tp ~ ~ ~`‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
-   `execute **in nether** positioned as @s run tp ~ ~ ~`‌^[*[Bedrock Edition] only*]^

If a player at position `(16,64,16)` in Overworld runs the following command, the player is teleported to `(2,64,2)` in the Nether.

-   `execute **in minecraft:the_nether** run tp ~ ~ ~`‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
-   `execute **in nether** run tp ~ ~ ~`‌^[*[Bedrock Edition] only*]^

If a player at position `(80,64,80)` in Overworld runs the following command, the player is teleported to `(10,64,15)` in the Nether.

-   `execute **in minecraft:the_nether** run tp ~ ~ ~5`‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
-   `execute **in nether** run tp ~ ~ ~5`‌^[*[Bedrock Edition] only*]^

#### on

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

Updates the *executor* to entities selected based on relation to the current executor entity. without changing *execution position*, *rotation*, *dimension*, and *anchor*.

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`on <*relation*> -> execute`

Arguments

*[JE]*: `<*relation*>`

A relation to the current executor entity.

-   `attacker`: the last entity that damaged the current executor entity in the previous 5 seconds. Note that damage types in `minecraft:no_anger` tag bypass the record of attacker. [Interaction] entities do not forget attacker after 5 seconds. Some mobs forget the attacker when ceasing their aggression.
-   `controller`: the entity that is riding and controlling the current executor entity. See [Riding#Controlling] for details.
-   `leasher`: the entity leading the current executor entity with a leash.
-   `origin`: the entity that cause the summon of the current executor entity. For example, the shooter of an arrow, the primer of a primed TNT entity.
-   `owner`: the owner of the current executor entity if it is a tameable animal.
-   `passengers`: all entities that are directly riding the current executor entity, no sub-passengers.
-   `target`: the target that the current executor entity intends on attacking. [Interaction] entities can select the last entity that interacted with them.
-   `vehicle`: the entity ridden by the current executor entity.

Result

*Executor* is updated based on the relation with the executor entity (which changes the meaning of `@s`).

Forks if `passengers` selects multiple entities. (Other relations can select only at most one entities.)

Terminates current branch if the current executor is not an entity.

Terminates current branch if the relation is not applicable to the current executor entity or there are no entities matching it.

Example

Damage 1 heart the entity that is leashing a cat: `execute as @e[type=cat] **on leasher** run damage @s 2 generic`

Give all players riding a boat a fishing rod: `execute as @e[type=boat] **on passengers** run give @s fishing_rod`

#### positioned

Sets the *execution position*, without changing *execution rotation* or *dimension*; can match an entity's position, or at one block above the Y-level stored in the specified [heightmap][JE only].

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`positioned <pos> -> execute`

`positioned as <targets> -> execute`

`positioned over <heightmap> -> execute`

Accepts [tilde and caret notations].

**Option:** `positioned as <targets>` or `positioned as <origin: target>`

*[JE]*: `<targets>`: [entity]\
*[BE]*: `origin: target`: [CommandSelector<Actor>]

Target entity/entities to match position with.

Must be a player name, a [target selector] or a [UUID]‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^.

**Option:** `positioned over <heightmap>`

*[JE]*: `<heightmap>`: [heightmap]

Specifies the [heightmap].

Must be one of `world_surface`, `motion_blocking`, `motion_blocking_no_leaves`, and `ocean_floor`.

Result

*Execution position* is updated. And `positioned <pos>` also resets *execution anchor* to feet.

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

Forks if `<targets>` or `origin: target` selects multiple entities.

Terminates current branch if `<targets>` or `origin: target` fails to resolve to one or more entities (named players must be online).

Example

Look for a village near (0, 64, 0):

-   `execute **positioned 0 64 0** run locate structure #village`‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
-   `execute **positioned 0 64 0** run locate structure village`‌^[*[Bedrock Edition] only*]^

#### rotated

Sets the *execution rotation*; can match an entity's rotation.

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`rotated <rot> -> execute`

`rotated as <targets> -> execute`

*[Bedrock Edition]*:

`rotated <yaw: value> <pitch: value> <chainedCommand: ExecuteChainedOption_0>`

`rotated as <origin: target> <chainedCommand: ExecuteChainedOption_0>`

Arguments

**Option:** `rotated <rot>` or `rotated <yaw: value> <pitch: value>`

*[JE]*: `<rot>`: [rotation] (`<yaw> <pitch>`)

*[BE]*: `yaw: value`: [RelativeFloat] and `pitch: value`: [RelativeFloat]

Angles of rotation.

Must be a rotation consisting of two double[JE only] or float[BE only] number elements, including yaw and pitch, measured in degrees.

-   For the horizontal rotation (yaw), -180.0 for due north, -90.0 for due east, 0.0 for due south, 90.0 for due west, to 179.9 for just west of due north, before wrapping back around to -180.0.
-   For the vertical rotation (pitch), -90.0 for straight up to 90.0 for straight down.

Tilde notation can be used to specify a rotation relative to the execution rotation.

**Option:** `rotated as <targets>` or `rotated as <origin: target>`

*[JE]*: `<targets>`: [entity]\
*[BE]*: `origin: target`: [CommandSelector<Actor>]

Target entity/entities to match rotation with.

Must be a player name, a [target selector] or a [UUID]‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^.

Result

*Execution rotation* is updated.

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

Forks if `<targets>` or `origin: target` selects multiple entities.

Terminates current branch if `<targets>` or `origin: target` fails to resolve to one or more valid entities (named players must be online).

Example

Move every sheep 1 block in the direction that the player closest to it is facing:

-   `execute as @e[type=sheep] at @s rotated as @p run tp @s ^ ^ ^1`
-   `execute as @e[type=sheep] positioned as @s rotated as @p run tp @s ^ ^ ^1`

#### summon

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

*Summons* a new entity at execution position and changes the *executor* to this summoned entity.

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

`summon <entity> -> execute`

Arguments

*[JE]*: `<entity>`: [resource]

The entity to be summoned and become the new executor.

Must be an existing registered [resource location] in `minecraft:entity_type` registry.

Result

*Summons* the entity and changes the *executor*.

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

Terminates current branch if execution position's <x> or <z> exceeds the range of [-30000000, 30000000), or <y> exceeds the range of [-20000000, 20000000).

Terminates the whole `/execute` command if the specified entity is `minecraft:player` or `minecraft:fishing_bobber`.

Example

Summon a sheep with the tag "Test": `execute **summon sheep** run tag *@s* add Test`

Summon a block display entiy and scale it: `execute **summon block_display** run data merge entity *@s* {transformation:{scale:[4.0,4.0,4.0]},block_state:{Name:"minecraft:dirt"}}`

### Condition subcommands

The particular use of the `if` and `unless` subcommands are to restrict command execution to happen only under specified conditions. In most cases, `unless` is a negation of `if`, equivalent to "if not...". The two subcommands have identical argument structures.

Result of condition subcommands

Unparseable if the arguments are not specified correctly.

In some cases, for example, testing a block outside the world, both `if` and `unless` terminates or fails.

When not at the end of the subcommands chain, only if the condition tests pass does the branch continue; otherwise it terminates.

In [*Java Edition*], if it is executed in multiple branches, it acts as a context filter (only branches with contexts that match the condition continue).

When at the end of the subcommands chain, it checks whether the condition is met and then outputs. In [*Java Edition*], it has output values that can be stored by store subcommands.

There are eleven[JE only]) / four[BE only] different types of conditions:

1.  [(if|unless) biome] -- Tests the biome in a position‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
2.  [(if|unless) block] -- Tests a single block
3.  [(if|unless) blocks] -- Tests blocks in a 3D rectangular volume against another
4.  [(if|unless) data] -- Tests for the data held by a block entity, an entity, or a storage‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
5.  [(if|unless) dimension] - Tests the dimension of the execution‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
6.  [(if|unless) entity] -- Tests whether an entity like the one given is real
7.  [(if|unless) function] -- Runs a function or function [tag] and tests its return value‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
8.  [(if|unless) items] -- Tests an inventory slot for a given item‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
9.  [(if|unless) loaded] -- Tests if a given position is loaded in the world‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
10. [(if|unless) predicate] -- Tests a [predicate]‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^
11. [(if|unless) score] - Tests a target's score

#### (if|unless) biome

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

Checks for a specific biome in a given position.

Syntax

`(if|unless) **biome** <pos> <biome> -> [execute]`

Arguments

`<pos>`: [block_pos]

Position to test.

Must be a [block position] composed of `<*X*>`, `<*Y*>` and `<*Z*>`, each of which must be an integer or a [tilde and caret notation].

`<biome>`: [resource_or_tag]

Biome(s) to test for.

Must be an existing registered [resource location] or [tag] in `minecraft:worldgen/biome` registry.

Result

Unparseable if the argument is not specified correctly.

In following conditions, terminates current branch when this subcommand is not at the end of the subcommand chain; fails when at the end:

-   If `<pos>` is unloaded or out of the world.
-   If test doesn't pass.

When at the end of the subcommand chain, if the command is successful, both `success` value and `result` value are 1.

#### (if|unless) block

Compares the block at a given position to a given block ID or a block tag‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^

Syntax

*[Java Edition]*:

### Store subcommand

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

Stores the final subcommand's `result` or `success` value somewhere. It is first processed along with other subcommands in the subcommand chain, recording the location to store in. After the last subcommand (may be a condition subcommand or a `run` subcommand) is executed, output values are stored in the recorded location. Note that the output values of commands are always an integer. If not, they are rounded down.

There are five different modes of storage:

1.  [store (result|success) block] -- Stores output value under one of a block's NBTs
2.  [store (result|success) bossbar] -- Stores output value as a bossbar data
3.  [store (result|success) entity] -- Stores output value under one of an entity's NBTs
4.  [store (result|success) score] -- Stores output value under a target's score on an objective
5.  [store (result|success) storage] -- Stores output value under one of a storage's NBTs

#### store (result|success) block

NBT structure
-------------

Every [entity] is an unnamed [NBT Compound / JSON Object] compound contained in the Entities list of a chunk file. The sole exception is the Player entity, stored in [level.dat], or in [<player>.dat] files on servers.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The root tag.
    -   [Int] DataVersion: Version of the chunk data.
    -   [Int Array] Position: Position of this chunk.
        -   [Int]: X coordinate.
        -   [Int]: Z coordinate.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] Entities: All the entities. Each compound in this list defines an entity in this chunk.
        -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object]: An entity. See [#Entity format] below.

Entity format
-------------

All entities are with the following structure:

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data

-   -   [Short] Air: How much air the entity has, in game ticks. Decreases when unable to breathe (except suffocating in a block). Increases when it can breathe. [Short] Air being `<= -20` game ticks (while still unable to breathe) on a given game tick causes the entity to immediately lose 1 health to [drowning] damage. This resets [Short] Air to 0 game ticks. Most mobs can have a maximum of 300 game ticks (15 seconds) of [Short] Air, while dolphins can reach up to 4800 game ticks (240 seconds), and axolotls have 6000 game ticks (300 seconds).
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object][NBT List / JSON Array][String] CustomName: The custom name [text component] of this entity. Appears in player death messages and villager trading interfaces, as well as above the entity when the player's cursor is over it. May be empty or not exist.
    -   [Boolean] CustomNameVisible: `1` or `0` (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, and this entity has a custom name, the name always appears above the entity, regardless of where the cursor points. If the entity does not have a custom name, a default name is shown. May not exist.
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] data: Any custom data. Used to store data the `custom_data` entity component which can be checked by [predicates].
    -   [Double] fall_distance: Distance the entity has fallen. Larger values cause more damage when the entity lands.
    -   [Short] Fire: Number of game ticks until the fire is put out. Negative values reflect how long the entity can stand in fire before burning. Default to -20 when not on fire.
    -   [Boolean] Glowing: `1` or `0` (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, the entity has a glowing outline.
    -   [Boolean] HasVisualFire: `1` or `0` (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, the entity visually appears on fire, even if it is not actually on fire.
    -   [String] id: [String representation] of the [entity's ID]. Does not exist for the Player entity.
    -   [Boolean] Invulnerable: `1` or `0` (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, the entity should not take damage. This applies to living and nonliving entities alike: mobs should not take damage from any source (including potion effects), and cannot be moved by fishing rods, attacks, explosions, or projectiles, and objects such as vehicles and item frames cannot be destroyed unless their supports are removed. Invulnerable player entities are also ignored by any hostile mobs. Note that these entities can be damaged by players in Creative mode.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] Motion: List of 3 [Double] doubles describing the current `dX`, `dY`, and `dZ` velocity of the entity in meters per game tick. Only allows between 10.0 and -10.0 (inclusive), else resets to 0.
    -   [Boolean] NoGravity: `1` or `0` (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, the entity does not fall down naturally. Set to `true` by striders in lava.
    -   [Boolean] OnGround: `1` or `0` (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, the entity is touching the ground.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] Passengers: The data of the entities that are riding this entity.
        -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object]: The same as this format (recursive). Note that each passenger entity, and the ridden entity (the vehicle) have equal control of the movement of the ridden entity. The topmost entity controls spawning conditions when the vehicle entity is created by a mob spawner.
            -   Tags common to all entities[]
            -   Tags unique to this passenger entity.
    -   [Int] PortalCooldown: The number of game ticks before which the entity may be teleported back through a nether portal. Initially starts at 300 game ticks (15 seconds) after teleportation and counts down to 0.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] Pos: List of 3 [Double] doubles describing the current X, Y, and Z position ([coordinates]) of the entity.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] Rotation: List of 2 floats representing the rotation of the entity's facing direction, in degrees. Facing direction can also be described as a looking direction, for most entity's that have heads.
        -   [Float] 0: The **yaw** of the entity's orientation. Yaw is the rotation around the Y axis (called yaw). Values vary from -180 degrees to +180 degrees, rather than from 0 to 360. As the entity turns to the right, this value goes up, and as the entity turns left, this value does down. See table of specific values here: [Chunk format/Entity/Rotation (yaw)] "Chunk format/Entity/Rotation (yaw)").
        -   [Float] 1: The **pitch** of the entity's orientation. Pitch is the offset from the horizon. Pitch = 0 means the direction is horizontal. A positive pitch (pitch > 0) means the entity is facing downward to some degree, or that the facing direction is facing below the horizon (toward the ground). A negative pitch (pitch > 0) means the entity is facing above the horizon (toward higher ground of the sky). Pitch is always between -90 and +90 degrees, where pitch = -90 means facing directly down, and pitch = +90 means facing directly up.
    -   [Boolean] Silent: `1` or `0` (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, this entity is silenced. May not exist.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] Tags: List of [scoreboard tags] of this entity. It is not preserved if it is removed.
    -   [Int] TicksFrozen: Optional. How many game ticks the entity has been [freezing]. Although this tag is defined for all entities, it is actually only used by [mobs] that are not in the `freeze_immune_entity_types` [entity type tag]. Increases while in [powder snow], even partially, up to a maximum of 300 game ticks (15 seconds), and decreases at double speed while not in powder snow.
    -   [Int Array] UUID: This entity's [Universally Unique IDentifier]. The 128-bit UUID is stored as four 32-bit integers ([Int] Ints), ordered from most to least significant.

### Mobs

Mobs are a subclass of Living Entity with additional tags to store their health, attacking/damaged state, potion effects, and more depending on the mob. [Players] and [armor stands] are a subclass of living entities.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] Mob data
    -   Tags common to all entities[]

-   -   [Float] AbsorptionAmount: number of extra health added by Absorption effect.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] active_effects: The list of potion effects on this mob. May not exist.
        -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] A potion effect
            -   [Boolean] ambient: 1 or 0 (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, this effect is provided by a Beacon and therefore should be less intrusive on screen.
            -   [Byte] amplifier: The potion effect level. 0 is level 1.
            -   [Int] duration: The number of [game ticks] before the effect wears off. -1 when infinite.
            -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] hidden_effect: Lower amplifier effect of the same type, this replaces the above effect when it expires. (The duration of the effect still decreases in here too)
            -   [String] id: The [effect name].
            -   [Boolean] show_icon: 1 or 0 (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, effect icon is shown; if `false`, no icon is shown.
            -   [Boolean] show_particles: 1 or 0 (`true`/`false`) - if `true`, particles are shown (affected by `ambient`); if `false`, no particles are shown.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] attributes: A list of [Attributes] for this mob. These are used for many purposes in internal calculations, and can be considered a mob's "statistics". Valid attributes for a given mob are listed in the [main article].
        -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] An individual attribute.
            -   [String] id: The name of this attribute.
            -   [Double] base: The base value of this attribute.
            -   [NBT List / JSON Array] modifiers: A list of [Modifiers] acting on this attribute. Modifiers alter the base value in internal calculations, without changing the original copy. Note that a modifier never modifies base to be higher than its maximum or lower than its minimum for a given attribute.
                -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] An individual modifier.
                    -   [Double] amount: The amount by which this modifier modifies the base value in calculations.
                    -   [String] id: A [Resource location] unique to this modifier. Used to identify the modifier so that the correct modifier can be added or removed.
                    -   [String] operation: `add_value`, `add_multiplied_base`, `add_multiplied_total`. Defines the operation this modifier executes on the attribute's base value.
                        -   `add_value`: Increment `X`by`Amount`.
                        -   `add_multiplied_base`: Increment `Y`by`X*Amount`.
                        -   `add_multiplied_total`: Set `Y = Y * (1 + Amount)` (equivalent to Increment `Y`by`Y * Amount`).
                -   The specified modifiers are applied to the attribute, probably whenever the attribute is modified.​^[*[more information needed]*]^ To compute the effective value of the attribute, the game:
                    1.  Sets `X = Base`.
                    2.  Executes all add_value modifiers.
                    3.  Sets `Y = X`.
                    4.  Executes all add_multiplied_base modifiers.
                    5.  Executes all add_multiplied_total modifiers.
                    -   The value Y is the final effective value of the attribute.​^[*[more information needed]*]^
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] Brain: Everything this entity has to keep in mind.
        -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] memories: Used for complex behaviors.​^[*[more information needed]*]^ The only mobs that have this tag are described below.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] Entity data
    -   Tags common to all entities[]
    -   Tags common to all minecarts[]
    -   [Short] Delay: Ticks until next spawn. If 0, it spawns immediately when a player enters its range. If set to -1 (this state never occurs in a natural spawner; it seems to be a feature accessed only via NBT editing), the spawner resets this and `SpawnData` as though it had just completed a successful spawn cycle, immediately when a player enters its range. Setting this to -1 can be useful if the player wants the game to properly randomize the spawner's `Delay` and `SpawnData`, rather than starting with pre-defined values.
    -   [Short] MaxNearbyEntities: Overrides the maximum number of nearby (within a box of `SpawnRange`*2+1 × `SpawnRange`*2+1 × 8 centered around the spawner block) entities whose IDs match this spawner's entity ID. This is relative to a mob's hitbox, not its physical position. Also, all entities within all chunk sections (16×16×16 cubes) overlapped by this box are tested for their ID and hitbox overlap, rather than just entities within the box, meaning that a large amount of entities outside the box (or within it, of course) can cause substantial lag.
    -   [Short] MaxSpawnDelay: The maximum random delay for the next spawn delay. Requires the `MinSpawnDelay` and `SpawnCount` properties to also be set.
    -   [Short] MinSpawnDelay: The minimum random delay for the next spawn delay. May be equal to `MaxSpawnDelay`. Requires the `SpawnCount` property to also be set, otherwise it defaults to 0.
    -   [Short] RequiredPlayerRange: Overrides the block radius of the sphere of activation by players for this spawner. For every gametick, a spawner checks all players in the current world to test whether a player is within this sphere. Requires the `MaxNearbyEntities` property to also be set.
    -   [Short] SpawnCount: How many mobs to attempt to spawn each time. Requires the `MinSpawnDelay` property to also be set.
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] SpawnData: Contains tags to copy to the *next* spawned entity(s) *after* spawning. *Any* of the entity or mob tags may be used. If a spawner specifies any of these tags, almost all variable data such as mob equipment, villager profession, sheep wool color, etc., are not automatically generated, and must also be manually specified (that this does not apply to position data, which are randomized as normal unless Pos is specified. Similarly, unless Size and Health are specified for a Slime or Magma Cube, these are still randomized). This also determines the appearance of the miniature entity spinning in the spawner cage. **Warning:** If `SpawnPotentials` exists, this tag gets overwritten after the next spawning attempt: see above for more details.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] SpawnPotentials: Optional. List of possible entities to spawn. If this tag does not exist, but `SpawnData` exists, Minecraft generates it the next time the spawner tries to spawn an entity. The generated list contains a single entry derived from the `SpawnData` tag.
        -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object]: A potential future spawn. *After* the spawner makes an attempt at spawning, it chooses one of these entries at random and uses it to prepare for the next spawn, overwriting `SpawnData`.
            -   [Int] weight: The chance that this spawn gets picked in comparison to other spawn weights. Must be positive and at least 1.
            -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] data
                -   Spawn Data[]
    -   [Short] SpawnRange: The radius around which the spawner attempts to place mobs randomly. The spawn area is square, includes the block the spawner is in, and is centered around the spawner's x,z coordinates - not the spawner itself. It is 2 blocks high, centered around the spawner's y coordinate (its bottom), allowing mobs to spawn as high as its top surface and as low as 1 block below its bottom surface. Vertical spawn coordinates are integers, while horizontal coordinates are floating point and weighted toward values near the spawner itself. Default value is 4.

    -   [Int] fuse: Time until explosion or -1 if not activated.
    -   [Float] explosion_power: A value from 0 to 128. Additional [explosion power], which is added to the speed-based explosion power. Defaults to 4.0. If set to the default value, this field is not saved to the entity's NBT.

### Dynamic tiles

Dynamic tiles are a subclass of Entity and are used to simulate realistically moving blocks.

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/EntitySprite_all-falling-blocks.png?2d297)][**falling_block**][]

    -   [Byte] CancelDrop: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the block should be destroyed instead of placed after landing on a solid block. When true, the block is not dropped as an item, even if the `DropItem` tag is set to true. However, if the entity is deleted due to its `Time` value being too high, this tag is ignored and an item is dropped depending on the `DropItem` tag. `CancelDrop` defaults to 1 for falling [suspicious sand] and [suspicious gravel], and 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
    -   [Byte] DropItem: 1 or 0 (true/false) -- true if the block should drop as an item when it breaks. Any block that does not have an item form *with the same ID as the block* does not drop even if this is set.
    -   [Float] FallHurtAmount: Multiplied by the `FallDistance` to calculate the amount of damage to inflict. By default this value is 2HP![❤️](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Heart_%28icon%29.png?faf83) for anvils, and 6HP![❤️](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Heart_%28icon%29.png?faf83)![❤️](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Heart_%28icon%29.png?faf83)![❤️](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Heart_%28icon%29.png?faf83) for pointed dripstone.
    -   [Int] FallHurtMax: The maximum hit points of damage to inflict on entities that intersect this falling block. For vanilla falling blocks, always 40HP![❤️](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Heart_%28icon%29.png?faf83) × 20.
    -   [Byte] HurtEntities: 1 or 0 (true/false) -- true if the block should hurt entities it falls on. Defaults to 1 for [anvils] and [pointed dripstone] and to 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] TileEntityData: Optional. The tags of the block entity for this block.
    -   [Int] Time: The number of ticks the entity has existed. When `Time` goes above 600, or above 100 while the block is at Y=-64 or is outside building height, the entity is deleted.

Similar to the background, the text rendering is discarded for values between 4 and 26. NBT stores the value as signed byte, -128 to 127. Defaults to -1, which represents 255 and is completely opaque. SNBT to NBT handles conversion from unsigned to signed, but if needed, replace values greater than 127 with `*alpha*-256` or `*alpha*UB`. Interpolated.

Adds or removes the [status effects] of [players] and other [entities].

Usage
-----

In [*Java Edition*], if a target already has a status effect with the same id, a new effect only with a longer duration or a higher amplifier can be added.

-   If the new effect has a higher amplifier and a shorter duration, the original effect is hidden.
-   If the new effect has a lower amplifier and a longer duration, the new effect is hidden.
    -   If their "hideParticles" values are different, the active effect's value is set to the specified value.
-   Otherwise, the original active effect is replaced by the new effect, without changing hidden effects.

Only if the active effect is changed does the command succeed, no matter whether the hidden effects are changed or not.

In [*Bedrock Edition*], if a target already has the status effect, a new status effect with the same amplifier overrides the old duration if it is longer, but a new status effect with a higher amplifier overrides any previous effect.

In [*Bedrock Edition*], no matter whether the new effect can override the original effect, "hideParticles" value is always applied.

In [*Bedrock Edition*], if the player uses an NBT editor to get negative levels of effects, the level of the effect jumps to 255 instead.

Attribute
=========

For the command, see [Commands/attribute].

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

An **attribute** is a value that determines certain properties of [mobs], [armor stands], and [players]. Attributes also have modifiers that adjust the strength of their effects.

Applying attributes
-------------------

Attributes can be applied directly to living entities using the `/[attribute]` command. The below command is an example that dramatically increases the luck attribute, leading to the player being able to fish treasures nearly every time:

`/[attribute] @p minecraft:luck base set 1024`

After it's modified, it can then be reset to the default value (which is 0.0 for `[minecraft:luck]` attribute):

`/[attribute] @p minecraft:luck base reset`

Additionally, attribute values can be specified when summoning a mob. For example, the following command summons a zombie that follows players when they are 100 blocks or fewer from it instead of the usual 40:

`/[summon] zombie ~ ~ ~ {attributes:[{id:"follow_range", base:100.0d}]}`

### Item modifiers

Attributes can also be applied as attribute modifiers on items by using [data components]. When applied to an item, a modifier adjusts the corresponding attribute if the item is held or worn.^[[1]]^^[[2]]^ Attribute modifiers can be added to items by adding data tags to the item. Each attribute modifier has a unique identifier, which is a [resource location] to identify the modifier.

The following command gives the player a netherite sword that deals 20HP![❤️](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Heart_%28icon%29.png?faf83) × 10 extra damage:

`/[give] @s netherite_sword[attribute_modifiers=[{type:"attack_damage", amount:20.0, operation:"add_value", id:"example:custom_damage", slot:"mainhand"}]]`

This section needs expansion.

You can help by [expanding it].\
*Instructions: Add all content from the infoboxes to the attribute descriptions. Add more details about how each attribute works to the attribute descriptions.*

A single attribute controls some property of an [entity], described by its *name*; it has a *base* value, set within hard-coded minimum and maximum limits, and if undefined, it's specified by the default value. The base value may be multiplied or added by a set of *modifiers*; these affect the attribute's *base*, but the calculated value is always capped by the minimum and maximum.

Attribute modifiers have [namespaced identifiers]. If two modifiers have the same ID and affect the same attribute, then they do not stack; instead, only the one most recently added takes effect, overriding previous modifiers.

These attributes are found on all living and undead entities, including players.

Movement speed is the speed at which entities can move, but this is not the actual speed value in blocks/second. The mob's actual speed in blocks/second is a bit over 20 times this value, but is affected by various conditions, such as the behavior it's following (e.g. idling, attacking or fleeing), being ridden (if a horse), sprinting, being led by a leash, and being under the effect of a Speed or Slowness potion. Baby mobs also have an additional speed multiplier on top of the base value.

Modifiers
---------

Modifiers increase or decrease the attribute's base value by using certain operations. The resulting value after modification is capped by the attribute's minimum and maximum limits. Similar to attribute names, modifiers have a [namespaced identifiers] to uniquely identify the modifier.

However, a modifier's ID does not define the modifier's behavior; instead, it is determined by its *operation*. Modifiers carry an *amount* to their modification. When attribute modifiers are applied to items, the *type* parameter is required; this defines which attribute the modifier affects. Modifiers can be added or removed from all living entities using the `/[attribute]` command, modifying the entity's [NBT data], or using item modifiers via [data components].

### Operations

Modifier operations dictate how it modifies an attribute base value. There are three operations that exist in the game:^[[note 1]]^

| Operation | Description |
| **add_value** | Adds all of the modifiers' amounts to the base attribute.

Total=Base+Amount1+Amount2+...+Amountn

For example, applying two **add_value** modifiers with amounts of 2 and 4, to attribute base of 3:

Total=3+2+4=9

 |
| **add_multiplied_base** | Multiplies the base attribute by (1 + sum of modifiers' amounts).

Total=Base×(1+Amount1+Amount2+...+Amountn)^[[note 2]]^

For example, applying two **add_multiplied_base** modifiers with amounts of 2 and 4, to attribute base of 3:

Total=3×(1+2+4)=3×7=21

 |
| **add_multiplied_total** | Multiplies the base attribute by (1 + modifiers' amounts) for every modifier.

Total=Base×(1+Amount1)×(1+Amount2)×...×(1+Amountn)

For example, applying two **add_multiplied_total** modifiers with amounts of 2 and 4, to attribute base of 3:

Total=3×(1+2)×(1+4)=3×3×5=45

 |

If multiple attribute modifiers are applied, the game first executes all **add_value** modifiers, then all **add_multiplied_base** modifiers, and finally all **add_multiplied_total** modifiers. The *Total* value is always carried as the *Base* for the next set of modifiers.

1.  `/[attribute] ... modifier add ...` command shows the literal name of the operations.
2.  Algebraically equivalent form. The original formula used in the game's code is like: Total=Base+(Base×Amount1)+(Base×Amount2)+...+(Base×Amountn)

### Vanilla modifiers

As stated before, a modifier's ID can be anything, and this does not affect its behavior. The following are known modifier IDs and values used in vanilla *Minecraft*. Manually setting vanilla modifiers with the correct ID and attribute overrides the default value.

Examples
--------

-   To view the NBT data of the player's held item:

    `/data get entity @s SelectedItem`

-   To get the saturation level of the current player:

    `/data get entity @s foodSaturationLevel`

-   To make the nearest item within 10 blocks unable to be picked up by players:

    `/data modify entity @e[type=item,distance=..10,limit=1,sort=nearest] PickupDelay set value -1`

-   To get the Y-position of a random item:

    `/data get entity @e[type=item,limit=1,sort=random] Pos[1]`

-   To get the item ID of the item in the first hotbar slot of the nearest player:

    `/data get entity @p Inventory[{Slot:0b}].id`

-   To set the armor [attribute] of the dolphin closest to coordinates (0, 64, 0) to 20:

    `/data modify entity @e[x=0,y=64,z=0,type=dolphin,limit=1] Attributes[{Name:"minecraft:generic.armor"}].Base set value 20`

-   To change the first item in a chest located at coordinates (1, 64, 1) into a diamond block, keeping all NBT data:

    `/data modify block 1 64 1 Items[0].id set value "minecraft:diamond_block"`

-   To make the nearest zombie have a 80% chance to drop items in its off-hand when it dies, and never drop items in the main hand:

    `/data merge entity @e[type=zombie,limit=1,sort=nearest] {HandDropChances: [0f, 0.8f]}`

-   To make the nearest zombie have a 80% chance to drop items in its off-hand when it dies, without affecting the chance for the main hand:

    `/data modify entity @e[type=zombie,limit=1,sort=nearest] HandDropChances[1] set value 0.8f`

### List, array and string length

With `/data get`, it is possible to get the length of lists or arrays and the number of characters in strings, since its return value is the length of the string, list, or arrays being referenced. This value can then be stored using `/[execute] store`, if necessary.

List example

Suppose a list is stored using the following command:

`/data merge storage wiki:example {List:[2,5,8,9,6,10]}`

Then, running the following returns `6`, the length of the list:

`/data get storage wiki:example List`

String example

Suppose a string is stored using the following command:

`/data merge storage wiki:example {String:"Example string with a character count of 43"}`

Then, running the following returns `43`, the length of the string:

`/data get storage wiki:example String`

NBT path
========

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

An **NBT path** is a descriptive string used to specify one or more particular elements from an [NBT data tree].

Usage
-----

The format of an NBT path is `node.node.....node`, i.e. one or more nodes represented by `.` (dot/period) characters. Dots before some certain nodes (e.g. `[]`. See table below) can be omitted. Each node declares what kinds of child tags should be selected from what kinds of current tags. When a node is applied on a tag, one or more child tags in it is selected.

Tags without tag names are aggregated into a collection, which is called a tag collection. The initial tag collection has only one element (the root tag). Each node in an NBT path is applied on the elements in the tag collection to generate a new tag collection. As nodes in the NBT path are applied one by one, the tag collection is constantly changing. After the last node is applied, the tags in the new tag collection are the tags selected by the NBT path.

If there are multiple elements in current tag collection, a node is applied on each element in the tag collection separately, and all the selected child tags are placed into the same new tag collection. For example: for `{tag1:1b, tag2:[{foo:0},{foo:[]},{foo:{}}]}`, path `tag2` selects only one tag: a list tag `[{foo:0},{foo:[]},{foo:{}}]`; Path `tag2.[]` selects three tags: three compound tags `{foo:0}`, `{foo:[]}`, and `{foo:{}}`; If adding another node after this path, the new node is applied on each of these three tags, e.g. path `tag2.[].foo` selects three tags: an integer tag `0`, a list tag `[]`, and a compound tag `{}`.

Some commands like `/[data] get ...` require the size of the tag collection obtained by the NBT path to be 1, that is, only one tag is selected.

And some commands like `/[data] modify ...` allow the size of the tag collection obtained by the NBT path to be greater than 1, that is, modifying more than one tags at once is allowed.

Nodes
-----

These are all six types of nodes available. Needed nodes can be used arbitrarily, except the root compound tag node is only applicable as the first element in an NBT path.

| Description | Format | When applied on a tag | Size of the new tag collection | Example | Example Description |
| Root compound tag | `{*tags*}`, where *tags* is used to match the content of the root tag (see [NBT format#Testing NBT tags]) and can be empty. | Selects the root tag, only if it matches the specified content *tags* (if given). | Only one element (the root compound tag) or empty if matching fails. | `**{Invisible:1b}**` | Selects the root tag if it has a child tag [Byte] Invisible with value `1`. |
| `**{}**` | Selects the root tag. |
| Named tag in current compound tag | `*name*`, where *name* can quoted by `'` or `"`. | Selects the child tag named *name* from the current tag, if the current tag is a compound tag. | Less than or equal to the current tag collection. May be empty. | `**VillagerData**` | Selects the child tag named `VillagerData`. |
| `**"A cool name[]"**` | Selects the child tag named `A cool name[]`. |
| Named compound tag in current compound tag | `*name*{*tags*}`, where *name* can quoted by `'` or `"`; *tags* is used to match the content of the root tag (see [NBT format#Testing NBT tags]) and can be empty. | Selects the child tag named *name* from the current tag, if the current tag is a compound tag, and if the named child tag is a compound tag and matching the specified content *tags* (if given). | All elements are compound type. Less than or equal to the current tag collection. May be empty. | `**VillagerData{foo:text}**` | Selects the child tag [NBT Compound / JSON Object] VillagerData only if it has a child tag [String] foo with value `text`. |
| `**VillagerData{}**` | Selects the child tag [NBT Compound / JSON Object] VillagerData if it is a compound tag. |
| All elements in current list or array tag | `[]`\
Dot before this node can be omitted. | Selects all elements of the current tag, if the current tag is a list or array tag. | Less than, equal to, or greater than the current tag collection. May be empty. | `**ActiveEffects[]**` | Select all the elements in the child tag "ActiveEffects". |
| Element in current list or array tag | `[*index*]`, where *index* is an integer.\
Dot before this node can be omitted. | Selects the element at *index* (or `listLength + index` when *index* is negative) of the current tag, if the current tag is a list or array tag. | Less than or equal to the current tag collection. May be empty. | `**Pos.[0]**`\
Or `**Pos[0]**` | Selects the first element in the child tag "Pos" list (or array). |
| `**Inventory.[-1]**`\
Or `**Inventory[-1]**` | Selects the last element in the child tag "Inventory" list (or array). |
| Compound elements in current list | `[{*tags*}]`, where *tags* is used to match the content of the root tag (see [NBT format#Testing NBT tags]) and can be empty.\
Dot before this node can be omitted. | Selects compound elements that matching the specified content *tags* (if given) from the current tags, if the current tag is a list tag. | Less than, equal to, or greater than the current tag collection. May be empty. | `**Inventory.[{Count:25b}]**`\
Or `**Inventory[{Count:25b}]**` | Selects [NBT Compound / JSON Object]compound elements that have a child tag [Byte] Count with value `25` from the child tag [NBT List / JSON Array] Inventory. |
| `**Foo.[{}]**`\
Or `**Foo[{}]**` | Selects [NBT Compound / JSON Object]compound elements in the child tag [NBT List / JSON Array] Foo. |
| `**foo.[].[{}]**`\
Or `**foo.[][{}]**`\
Or `**foo[].[{}]**`\
Or `**foo[][{}]**` | Select [NBT Compound / JSON Object]compound elements in the lists in the [NBT List / JSON Array] foo list. |
| `**foo.bar.[0].[0].baz**`Or `**foo.bar[0][0].baz**` etc. | Select the baz tag in the first compound element in the first list element in the bar list in the [NBT Compound / JSON Object] foo tag. |

### Example 2

`/data get block ~ ~ ~ Items[1].components.minecraft:written_book_content.pages[3].raw`

A player has written a book and placed it inside a chest, and Alex is going to work up to the above command in stages. Observe the following imaginary chat log:

 |Target selectors
================

Not to be confused with [Target].

**Target selectors** are used in [commands] to select players and entities arbitrarily, without needing to specify an exact player name or a [UUID]. One or more entities can be selected with a target selector variable, and targets can be filtered from the selection based on certain criteria using the target selector arguments.

Target selector variables
-------------------------

Summary of target selector variables
| Variable | Selects |
| `@p` | the nearest player |
| `@r` | a random player |
| `@a` | all players |
| `@e` | all entities |
| `@s` | the entity executing the command |
| `@n` | the nearest entity |
| `@c` | the player's agent‌^[*[Minecraft Education] only*]^ |
| `@v` | all agents‌^[*[Minecraft Education] only*]^ |
| `@initiator` | the player who clicks an [NPC] [dialogue] button‌^[*[BE] & [edu] only*]^ |

A target selector variable identifies the broad category of targets to select. There are six (eight in [*Minecraft Education*]) variables:

`@p`

Selects the nearest player from the command's execution. If there are multiple nearest players, caused by them being precisely the same distance away, the player who most recently joined the server is selected.

In [*Bedrock Edition*], `@p` selects only players who are alive.

`@n`

Selects the nearest alive entity from the command's execution.

`@r`

Selects a random online player.

In *[Bedrock Edition]*, you can use `@r` to select non-player entities via the `type` selector argument; in [*Java Edition*], to select a random entity, use `@e[sort=random,limit=1]` or `@n[sort=random]` instead.

In [*Bedrock Edition*], `@r` can select only entities who are alive.

`@a`

Selects every online player (alive or dead).

`@e`

Selects all alive entities in loaded chunks, and all alive online players.

`@s`

Selects the entity (alive or not) that the command was executed as. It does not select anything if the command was not ran as an entity (e.g. from a command block or server console).

`@c`‌^[*[Minecraft Education] only*]^

Selects the player's agent only.

`@v`‌^[*[Minecraft Education] only*]^

Selects all agents. Works only if more than one agent exists.

`@initiator`‌^[*[Bedrock Edition] only*]^

Selects the player who interacts with a button in a JSON [NPC] [dialogue].

After a target selector, optional arguments can be used to narrow down the set of targets to a group that also matches certain criteria. When used with `@a` or `@e`, arguments narrow down the targets from the full list to a specific group. When used with `@p` or `@r`, the nearest or random player is selected from the group. When used with `@s`, the player using the command is targeted only if they would be in the narrowed group.

Argument-value pairs appear within square brackets after the target selector variable, separated by commas:

`@<variable>[<argument>=<value>,<argument>=<value>,...]`.

In [*Java Edition*], arguments and values are case-sensitive. Spaces are allowed around the brackets, equal signs, and commas, except in [*Java Edition*] between the target variable and the first bracket. Commas must be used to separate argument-value pairs.

If there are multiple argument-value pairs, they all must be satisfied to add a potential target to the group. (In other words, they are AND-ed together).

### Position arguments

`[x=<value>,y=<value>,z=<value>]` --- Define a position in the world that the selector starts at, for use with the [distance] argument, the [volume] arguments, or the [sort and limit] arguments. Using these arguments alone does not restrict the entities found (except in [*Java Edition*]), and affect only the sorting of targets. Cannot duplicate any one of these three arguments.

The positional components are doubles, allowing for values like `12.34`. In [*Java Edition*] they are not center-corrected, meaning `x=0` is not corrected to `x=0.5`. In [*Bedrock Edition*], positions that are written as integers *are* center-corrected, `x=0` becomes `x=0.5`. To avoid this, use `x=0.0` instead.

In [*Bedrock Edition*], [tilde notation] is available for selector argument coordinates. Note: [Caret notation] is not.

In [*Java Edition*], these arguments limit the search of entities to the current dimension. For example `/execute in overworld as @e[x=0]` will select only entities that are in the *overworld*.

### Selecting targets by distance

Filter target selection based on their Euclidean distances from some point, searching for the target's feet (a point at the bottom of the center of their hitbox). If the positional arguments are left undefined, radius is calculated relative to the position of the command's execution. This argument limits the search of entities to the current dimension. Cannot duplicate these arguments.

In [*Java Edition*]: `[distance=<value>]` --- Specifies the range of distance. [Float ranges] are supported to select a specific region. Only unsigned values are allowed.

In [*Bedrock Edition*]: `[r=<value>]` and `[rm=<value>]` --- Specifies the maximum and minimum range to find entities, respectively. Only unsigned values are allowed.

Examples in [*Java Edition*]:

-   `@e[distance=10..]` --- Target all entities more than ten blocks away.
-   `@e[distance=..10]` --- Target all entities less than ten blocks away.
-   `@e[distance=10]` --- Target all entities exactly ten blocks away.
-   `@e[distance=8..16]` --- Target all entities more than eight blocks, but less than 16 blocks away (inclusive).

Examples in [*Bedrock Edition*]:

-   `@e[r=10]` --- Target all entities that are ten or fewer blocks away.
-   `@e[rm=10]` --- Target all entities that are ten or more blocks away.
-   `@e[rm=10,r=10]` --- Target all entities exactly ten blocks away.
-   `@e[rm=8,r=16]` --- Target all entities from 8 to 16 blocks away.

### Selecting targets by volume

`[dx=<value>,dy=<value>,dz=<value>]` --- Filter target selection based on their x-difference, y-difference, and z-difference from some point, as measured by entities' hitboxes. Cannot duplicate any one of these three arguments.

Numerically, this can be interpreted as creating a cuboid volume from the initial position `(x,y,z)` to `(x+dx,y+dy,z+dz)` but with the vector `(1,1,1)` added to the x-most, y-most, z-most corner (the upper south-east corner). Then, all entities whose hitboxes at least partially intersect with that volume are selected. If the positional arguments are left out, the selection is interpreted as originating from the position of the command's execution. Any values are allowed, including signed and fractional numbers.

If all of the values are whole numbers, this can be interpretted as creating a volume of blocks from the initial position (`x y z`) to the delta position (`x+dx y+dy z+dz)`) and selecting any entity whose hitbox intersects with those blocks. So, if you have built a cuboid of blocks in the world, you can subtract the coordinates of one corner block from the coordinates of the opposite corner block to get the `dx`, `dy`, and `dz` values for selecting those entities.

Note that `dx`, `dy`, and `dz` specify *signed differences* from the given coordinate. They do not specify a separate coordinate, nor do they extend in both the positive and negative directions as you might expect from a position predicate.

Additionally, when only one or two volume arguments are present, any that are not specified are assumed to be set to zero. For example, `@a[dx=15]` is equivalent to `@a[dx=15,dy=0,dz=0]`.

Examples:

-   `@e[x=1,y=2,z=3,dx=0,dy=0,dz=0]` --- Select all entities whose hitbox intersects with the block at `1 2 3`.
-   `@e[x=1,y=2,z=3,dx=4,dy=5,dz=-6]` --- Select all entities whose hitbox intersects with the block region `1~5, 2~7, -3~3`.
    -   (or, the numerically speaking, a cuboid from `1.0 2.0 -3.0` to `6.0 8.0 4.0`).
    -   (or, mathematically speaking, the region that is `{ (x,y,z)∈R³ | x∈[1.0,6.0], y∈[2.0,8.0], z∈[-3.0,4.0] }`), or [1,6]×[2,8]×[-3,4]⊂ℝ3

It is possible to combine selection by distance and selection by volume, in which case the command select targets only within the overlap of both regions (within a certain radius of the volume's initial point and not outside the defined volume) --- but note that distance selection checks that the *point* at an entity's feet intersects with some sphere, wheras volume selection checks that the entity's *hitbox* overlaps with some region.

### Selecting targets by scores

`[scores={<objective>=<value>,...}]` --- Filter target selection based on their scores in the specified objectives. All tested objectives are in a single object, separated by commas. Each objective and score value pair is separated by an equals sign. The score values support [integer ranges]. Cannot duplicate this argument.

-   `@e[scores={myscore=10}]` --- Select all entities with a score in objective *myscore* of exactly ten.
-   `@e[scores={myscore=10..12}]` --- Select all entities with a score in objective *myscore* of between ten and 12 (inclusive).
-   `@e[scores={myscore=5..}]` --- Select all entities with a score in objective *myscore* of five or greater.
-   `@e[scores={myscore=..15}]` --- Select all entities with a score in objective *myscore* of 15 or less.
-   `@e[scores={foo=10,bar=1..5}]` --- Select all entities with a score in objective *foo* of exactly ten, and a score in objective *bar* of between one and five (inclusive).

In [*Bedrock Edition*], `!` can be used to invert selection.

-   `@e[scores={myscore=!10}]` --- Exclude any entities with a score in objective *myscore* of exactly ten.
-   `@e[scores={myscore=!10..15}]` --- Exclude any entities with a score in objective *myscore* of between ten and 15 (inclusive).

### Selecting targets by tag

Filter target selection based on the entity's [scoreboard tags]. Multiple tag arguments are allowed, and all arguments must be fulfilled for an entity to be selected.

`[tag=<string>]` --- Include only targets with the specified tag.

`[tag=!<string>]` --- Exclude any targets with the specified tag.

`[tag=]` --- Include only targets with exactly zero tags.

`[tag=!]` --- Include only targets that have at least one tag.

See also: [Commands/tag]

### Selecting targets by team

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

Filter target selection based on [teams]. Arguments testing for equality cannot be duplicated, while arguments testing for inequality can.

`[team=<teamName>]` --- Include only targets in the given team.

`[team=!<teamName>]` --- Exclude any targets in the given team.

`[team=]` --- Include only targets not in a team.

`[team=!]` --- Exclude any targets not in a team.

Note, prior to 1.21.5, this also excluded all non-living targets (such as minecarts, markers, etc.).

See also: [Commands/team]

### Limiting and sorting target selection

Limit the number of selectable targets for a target selector.

When using the variables `@p` and `@r`, this argument defaults to one. Applying the limiting argument to them may increase the number of nearest or random targets selected. When applying this argument to `@a` or `@e`, this argument returns only a limited number of targets. Cannot duplicate these arguments.

In [*Java Edition*]: `[limit=<value>,sort=(nearest|furthest|random|arbitrary)]` --- Limit the number of targets, and specify selection priority.

-   `sort=nearest` --- Sort by increasing distance. (Default for `@p`)
-   `sort=furthest` --- Sort by decreasing distance.
-   `sort=random` --- Sort randomly. (Default for `@r`)
-   `sort=arbitrary` --- Do not sort. This often returns the oldest entities first due to how the game stores entities internally, but no order is guaranteed. (Default for `@e`, `@a`)

In [*Bedrock Edition*]: `[c=<value>]` --- Limit the number of targets.

For `@p`, `@a`, and `@e`, `[c=<value>]` selects only the specified number of targets by increasing distance from the selector's position. When `c` is negative, it reverses the order of targeting (for example, `@p[c=-1]` targets the furthest player). Inverse sorting does not work with `@r`.

Examples in [*Java Edition*]:

-   `@a[limit=3,sort=nearest]` or `@p[limit=3]` --- Select the nearest three players.
-   `@a[limit=4,sort=furthest]` --- Select the furthest four players.
-   `@a[limit=2,sort=random]` or `@r[limit=2]` --- Select two players, chosen randomly.

Examples in [*Bedrock Edition*]:

-   `@a[c=3]` --- Select the nearest three players.
-   `@a[c=-4]` --- Select the furthest four players.
-   `@r[c=2]` --- Select two living players, chosen randomly.

### Selecting targets by experience level

Filter target selection based on the entity's [experience levels]. This naturally filters out all non-player targets. Cannot duplicate these arguments.

In [*Java Edition*]: `[level=<value>]` --- Specifies the range of levels. [Integer ranges] are supported to select a range of values.

In [*Bedrock Edition*]: `[l=<value>]` and `[lm=<value>]` --- the maximum and minimum level range to search for, respectively.

Examples in [*Java Edition*]:

-   `@a[level=10]` --- Select all players who have exactly ten levels.
-   `@a[level=8..16]` --- Select all players who have between eight and 16 levels (inclusive).

Examples in [*Bedrock Edition*]:

-   `@a[lm=10,l=10]` --- Select all players who have exactly ten levels.
-   `@a[lm=8,l=16]` --- Select all players who have between eight and 16 levels (inclusive).

See also: [Commands/experience]

### Selecting targets by game mode

Filter target selection by [game mode]. This naturally filters out all non-player targets. Arguments testing for equality cannot be duplicated, while arguments testing for inequality can.

In [*Java Edition*]:

`[gamemode=<gamemodeName>]` --- Include only players in the given game mode.

`[gamemode=!<gamemodeName>]` --- Exclude any players in the given game mode.

In [*Bedrock Edition*]:

`[m=<gamemodeName>]` --- Include only players in the given game mode.

`[m=!<gamemodeName>]` --- Exclude any players in the given game mode.

Permitted values for <gamemodeName> are `spectator`, `survival`, `creative`, `adventure` and `default`[BE only]. In [*Bedrock Edition*], the shorthand values `s` and `0`, `c` and `1`, `a` and `2`, and `d` and `5` may be used for Survival mode, Creative mode, Adventure mode, and Default mode respectively.

See also: [Commands/gamemode]

### Selecting targets by name

Filter target selection by name. Values are strings, so spaces are allowed only if quotes are applied. This cannot be a JSON text compound. Arguments testing for equality cannot be duplicated, while arguments testing for inequality can.

`[name=<givenName>]` --- Include only targets with the given name.

`[name=!<givenName>]` --- Exclude any targets with the given name.

### Selecting targets by vertical rotation

Filter target selection based on the entity's rotation along the pitch axis, measured in degrees. Values range from -90 (straight up) to 0 (at the horizon) to +90 (straight down). Cannot duplicate these arguments.

In [*Java Edition*]: `[x_rotation=<value>]` --- Specifies the range of x-rotation. [Float ranges] are supported to select a specific range of angles.

In [*Bedrock Edition*] `[rx=<value>]` and `[rxm=<value>]` --- Specifies the maximum and minimum x-rotation, respectively.

Examples in [*Java Edition*]:

-   `@e[x_rotation=0]` --- Select all entities that are looking directly at the horizon.
-   `@e[x_rotation=30..60]` --- Select all entities that are looking between 30° and 60° (inclusive) below the horizon.
-   `@e[x_rotation=..0]` --- Select all entities that are looking at or above the horizon.

Examples in [*Bedrock Edition*]:

-   `@e[rxm=0,rx=0]` --- Selects all entities that are looking directly at the horizon.
-   `@e[rxm=30,rx=60]` --- Selects all entities that are looking between 30° and 60° (inclusive) below the horizon.
-   `@e[rx=0]` --- Select all entities that are looking at or above the horizon.

### Selecting targets by horizontal rotation

Filter target selection based on the entity's rotation along the yaw axis, measured clockwise in degrees from due south (or the positive Z direction). Values vary from -180 (facing due north) to -90 (facing due east) to 0 (facing due south) to +90 (facing due west) to +180 (facing due north again). Cannot duplicate these arguments.

In [*Java Edition*]: `[y_rotation=<value>]` --- Specifies the range of y-rotation. [Float Ranges] are supported to select a specific range of angles.

In [*Bedrock Edition*]: `[ry=<value>]` and `[rym=<value>]` --- Specifies the maximum and minimum y-rotation values, respectively.

Examples in [*Java Edition*]:

-   `@e[y_rotation=0]` --- Select all entities that are facing due south.
-   `@e[y_rotation=-90..0]` --- Select all entities that are facing in the 90° between due east and due south (inclusive).
-   `@e[y_rotation=0..180]` --- Select all entities that are not facing at all east.

Examples in [*Bedrock Edition*]:

-   `@e[rym=0,ry=0]` --- Select all entities that are facing due south.
-   `@e[rym=-90,ry=0]` --- Select all entities that are facing in the 90° between due east and due south (inclusive).
-   `@e[rym=0,ry=180]` --- Select all entities that are not facing at all east.

### Selecting targets by type

Filter target selection based on the entity's identifier. The given entity type must be a valid [entity ID] or [entity type tag]‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^ used to identify different types of entities internally. The namespace can be left out if the ID is within the `minecraft` namespace. Entity IDs or tags are case-sensitive. Arguments testing for equality cannot be duplicated, while arguments testing for inequality can. In [*Java Edition*], using this argument with `@a`, `@p` or `@r` is not allowed.

`[type=<entityType>]` --- Include only targets of the specified entity type or tag.

`[type=!<entityType>]` --- Exclude any targets of the specified entity type or tag.

In [*Java Edition*], the option `type=<entityType>` (without `!` symbol) can appear only once, and `type=!<entityType>` cannot appear with it. If `type=<entityType>` does not exist, then `type=!<entityType>` may appear multiple times.

Examples:

-   `@e[type=creeper]` - Include only creepers.
-   `@e[type=creeper, type=pig]` - Invalid selector.
-   `@e[type=creeper, type=!pig]` - Invalid selector.
-   `@e[type=!creeper, type=!pig]` - Exclude all creepers and pigs.

### Selecting targets by family

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Bedrock Edition*].

Filter target selection based on the entity's [type_family](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/entityreference/examples/entitycomponents/minecraftcomponent_type_family) behavior component. Default values used by the vanilla behavior pack include among others more broad terms like `mob` and `inanimate`, as well as more specific families like `zombie` and `skeleton`, and single-mob families like `wandering_trader` and `creeper`. Multiple family arguments are allowed, and all arguments must be fulfilled for an entity to be selected.

Main article: [family]

`[family=<family>]` --- Include only targets in the specified type family.

`[family=!<family>]` --- Exclude any targets in the specified type family.

-   `@e[family=skeleton]` --- Select all skeletons, wither skeletons, strays, and bogged.
-   `@e[family=mob,family=!monster]` --- Select all mobs that are not monsters (so for example cows, chickens, pigs, but not zombies or skeletons).
-   `@e[family=monster,family=undead]` --- Select all monsters that are also undead (that includes monsters like zombies and skeletons, but not creepers, spiders or endermen).

### Selecting targets by NBT data

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

Filter target selection based on the entity's NBT data. The NBT data is written in its [SNBT format]. Duplicate nbt arguments are allowed, and all arguments must be fulfilled for an entity to be selected.

See [NBT format#Testing NBT tags] for more infomation about this.

Note that this selector argument should be used with care, as accessing NBT data is a heavy process for the CPU.

`[nbt=<compoundTag>]` --- Include only targets with the specified NBT data.

`[nbt=!<compoundTag>]` --- Exclude any targets with the specified NBT data.

-   `@a[nbt={OnGround:true}]` --- Select all players on the ground.
-   `@e[type=sheep,nbt={Color:0b}]` --- Select all sheep that are dyed white.
-   `@e[type=item,nbt={Item:{id:"minecraft:slime_ball"}}]` --- Selects all slime ball item entities.
-   `@e[nbt={Tags:[a,b]}]` is the same as `@e[tag=a,tag=b]`. The latter is simpler and reduces CPU load.

### Selecting targets by advancements

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

Filter target selection based on the entity's [advancements]. This naturally filters out all non-player targets. All advancements are in a single object, with a list of individual advancement IDs between the braces afterward. The values are [true or false]. For advancements with one criterion, testing for that criterion always gives the same results as testing for the advancement. Cannot duplicate this argument.

`[advancements={<*resource location*>=<bool>}]` --- Include only players with the specified advancements and values.

`[advancements={<*resource location*>={<criteria>=<bool>}}]` --- Include only players with the specified advancement's criteria.

-   `@a[advancements={story/smelt_iron=true}]` --- Include only players who have completed the advancement `minecraft:story/smelt_iron`.
-   `@a[advancements={story/form_obsidian=false}]` --- Include only players who haven't completed the advancement `minecraft:story/form_obsidian`.
-   `@a[advancements={story/follow_ender_eye=true}]` is the same as `@a[advancements={story/follow_ender_eye={in_stronghold=true}}]`.
-   `@a[advancements={adventure/kill_all_mobs={witch=true}}]` --- Include only players who have killed a witch, for the advancement `minecraft:adventure/kill_all_mobs`.

See also: [Commands/advancement]

### Selecting targets by predicate

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

Filter target selection by [predicates]. The given values must be a valid predicate represented by a resource location. Duplicate predicate arguments are allowed, and all arguments must be fulfilled for an entity to be selected.

`[predicate=<*resource location*>]` --- Include only targets that match the specified predicate.

`[predicate=!<*resource location*>]` --- Exclude any targets that match the specified predicate.

### Selecting targets by item

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Bedrock Edition*].

Filter target selection based on whether the entity has the specified items. The given values must be enclosed by square brackets or braces. Cannot duplicate this argument, but multiple items can be specified with square brackets.

`[hasitem={<*argument*>=<*value*>,<*argument2*>=<*value2*>,...}]` --- Include only targets that have the specified items.

`[hasitem=[{<*argumentA*>=<*valueA*>,...},{<*argumentB*>=<*valueB*>,...}]]` --- Include only targets that have item A and item B, etc.

All acceptable arguments are as follows:

(More information about what this section is looking for should be given as this section is too vauge.)

-   `item` (required)

    Must be an [item] ID.

-   `data`

    Specifies the item data for the item(s). Must be a 32-bit integer number. Values that are invalid for the specified item id default to 0. If not specified, defaults to 0.

    Note that because it defaults to 0, selectors like `{item=potion}` can target only water bottle, though `{item=potion,data=1}` can target mundane potion.

    Currently doesn't work on blocks' direct item forms (e.g. dirt, stone). For these items, `data` is always considered as invalid and defaults back to 0, and aux value of these items in inventory are also always considered as 0. That means you can't target items like coarse dirt, green wool solely.

    For potion and tipped arrow, aux value represents the data value of potion effect, and currently invalid values crash the game.

-   `quantity`

    Specifies the amount of the items the entity has. Must be an integer range (e.g. `1` - exact match of 1. `..5` - less than or equal to 5. `5..` - more than or equal to 5. `0..5` - between 0 and 5, inclusive.).

    `!` can be used to invert selection. For example, `{item=apple,quantity=!5}` can exclusive entities who have five apples.

    When not specified, defaults to `quantity=1..`. When `quantity=0`, entities must have 0 the specified item (i.e. do not have the specified item) to be targeted.

-   `location` and `slot`

    Specifies the inventory slot to test. See [Slot] for details.

    Specifying `slot` without `location` is invalid.

    `slot` must be an integer range. (e.g. `1` - exact match of 1. `..5` - less than or equal to 5. `5..` - more than or equal to 5. `0..5` - between 0 and 5, inclusive.)

-   Example using location: `@s[hasitem={item=stick,location=slot.weapon.mainhand}]`

### Selecting targets by permission

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Bedrock Edition*].

`[haspermission={<permission>=<state>,...}]` --- Filter target selection based on the player permissions status. All tested permissions are in a single object, separated by commas. Cannot duplicate this argument.

-   `@a[haspermission={camera=enabled}]` --- Include only players who have the camera permission enabled.
-   `@a[haspermission={movement=disabled}]` --- Include only players who have the movement permission disabled.
-   `@a[haspermission={camera=disabled,movement=enabled}]` --- Include only players who have the camera permission disabled and the movement permission enabled.

See also: [Commands/inputpermission]

### Selecting targets by property

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Bedrock Edition*].

Filter target selection based on the entity's property. All tested properties are in a single object, separated by commas. Cannot duplicate this argument.

`[has_property={<property>=<value>,...}]` --- Include only targets that have the specified property values.

`[has_property={<property>=!<value>,...}]` --- Exclude only targets that have the specified property values.

`[has_property={property=<property>,...}]` --- Include only targets that have the specified properties.

`[has_property={property=!<property>,...}]` --- Exclude only targets that have the specified properties.

-   `@e[type=chicken,has_property={minecraft:climate_variant=!"cold"}]` --- Selects all chickens that do not have the `minecraft:climate_variant` property `*cold*`.

Player type and single type
---------------------------

### Player type

Some command arguments require a player-type selector, while some require an entity-type selector.

Entity type means that there's no additional restrictions. Any valid selector can be used in this command argument.

A player-type selector is a selector that can only select players, including:

-   `@e, @n` with `type=player`.
-   `@a, @p` (without `type` argument in [*Bedrock Edition*]).
-   `@r` with `type=player`‌^[*[Bedrock Edition] only*]^ or without `type` argument.

In [*Java Edition*], if a command argument requires a player type selector, but the entered argument is not in player type, the command is unparseable.

In [*Bedrock Edition*], if a command argument requires a player type selector, but the entered argument is not in player type, the command is parseable but fails.

### Single type

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Information_icon.svg?15c1c)]

This feature is exclusive to [*Java Edition*].

Some command arguments require a single-type selector, while some require a multiple-type selector.

Multiple type means that there's no additional restrictions. Any valid selector can be used in this command argument.

A single-type selector is a selector that can only select one target, including:

-   `@a, @e` with `limit=1`.
-   `@s` without `limit` argument.
-   `@p, @r` without `limit` argument or with `limit=1`.

If a command argument requires a single-type selector, but the entered argument is not in single-type, the command is unparseable.

Fills all or parts of a region with a specific [block].

Syntax
------

-   **Java Edition**

`fill <from> <to> <block> [outline|hollow|destroy|strict|replace|keep]`

`fill <from> <to> <block> replace <filter> [outline|hollow|destroy|strict]`

-   **Bedrock Edition**

`fill <from: x y z> <to: x y z> <tileName: Block> <blockStates: block states> [oldBlockHandling: FillMode]`

`fill <from: x y z> <to: x y z> <tileName: Block> [oldBlockHandling: FillMode]`

The fill command also has an optional alternate syntax for `replace` mode:

`fill <from: x y z> <to: x y z> <tileName: Block> <blockStates: block states> replace [replaceTileName: Block] [replaceBlockStates: block states]`

`fill <from: x y z> <to: x y z> <tileName: Block> replace [replaceTileName: Block] [replaceBlockStates: block states]`

Arguments
---------

*[JE]*: `<from>`: [block_pos] and `<to>`: [block_pos]\
*[BE]*: `from: x y z`: [CommandPosition] and `to: x y z`: [CommandPosition]

Specifies any two opposing corner blocks of the region to be filled (the "fill region").

In [*Java Edition*], must be a [block position] composed of `<*X*>`, `<*Y*>` and `<*Z*>`, each of which must be an integer or a [tilde and caret notation]. In [*Bedrock Edition*], must be a three-dimensional coordinates composed of `<*X*>`, `<*Y*>` and `<*Z*>`, each of which must be a [single-precision floating-point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_precision_floating-point_format "wikipedia:Single precision floating-point format") or [tilde and caret notation].

Block position is the coordinates of the point at the lower northwest corner of a block. Because of this, the lesser coordinates of each axis are on the region boundary, but the greater coordinates are one block from the boundary, and the block volume of the source region is (x~greater~ - x~lesser~ + 1) × (y~greater~ - y~lesser~ + 1) × (z~greater~ - z~lesser~ + 1). For example, `0 0 0 0 0 0` has a 1-block volume, and `0 0 0 1 1 1` and `1 1 1 0 0 0` both identify the same region with an 8-block volume.

*[JE]*: `<block>`: [block_state]\
*[BE]*: `tileName: Block`: [enum]

Specifies the block to fill the region with.

In [*Java Edition*], must be in the format of `block_id[block_states]{data_tags}`(does not accept block tags), in which block states and data tags can be omitted when they are not needed. In [*Bedrock Edition*], must be a [block id].

*[BE]*: `blockStates: block states`: [BlockStateCommandParam]

Specifies the [block states] to use for the block.

Must be a blockstate argument as `["<*state1*>"=<*value1*>,"<*state2*>"=<*value2*>,...]`. For example: `["old_leaf_type"="birch","persistent_bit"=true]`.

*[JE]*: `outline|hollow|destroy|strict|replace|keep`, `replace`, and `outline|hollow|destroy|strict`\
*[BE]*: `oldBlockHandling: FillMode`: [enum]

Specifies the handling of the block changes. Must be one of the following:

-   `destroy` - Replaces all blocks (including air) in the fill region with the specified block, dropping the existing blocks (including those that are unchanged) and block contents as entities as if they had been mined with an unenchanted diamond [shovel] or [pickaxe]. (Blocks that can be mined only with [shears], such as [vines], do not drop; neither do liquids.)
-   `hollow` - Replaces only the blocks on the outer edge of the fill region with the specified block. Inner blocks are changed to air, dropping their contents as entities but not themselves. If the fill region has no inner blocks (because it is smaller than three blocks in at least one dimension), acts like `replace`.
-   `keep` - Replaces only the air blocks in the fill region with the specified block.
-   `outline` - Replaces only the blocks on the outer edge of the fill region with the specified block. Inner blocks are not affected. If the fill region has no inner blocks (because it is smaller than three blocks in at least one dimension), acts like `replace`.
-   `replace` - Replaces all blocks (including air) in the fill region with the specified block, without dropping blocks or block contents as entities. Optionally, block ID and data values may be specified to limit which blocks are replaced.
-   `strict` - Place blocks as-is without triggering block updates and shape updates.

If not specified, defaults to `replace`.

*[JE]*: `<filter>`: [block_predicate]\
*[BE]*: `replaceTileName: Block`: [enum]

Specifies the ID of the blocks in the fill region to be replaced. If not specified, replaces all blocks in the fill region.

In [*Java Edition*], must be in the format of `block_id[block_states]{data_tags}`(accepts block tags), in which block states and data tags can be omitted when they are not needed. In [*Bedrock Edition*], must be a [block id].

*[BE]*: `replaceBlockStates: block states`: [BlockStateCommandParam]

Specifies the [block states] to use for the block to be replaced.

Must be a blockstate argument as `["<*state1*>"=<*value1*>,"<*state2*>"=<*value2*>,...]`. For example: `["old_leaf_type"="birch","persistent_bit"=true]`.

Teleports [entities] (players, mobs, etc.).

Although most [commands] can affect only [chunks] that have already been generated, `/teleport` can send entities into chunks that have yet to be generated. Right before teleporting, the game generates the destination chunk.

Syntax
------

-   **Java Edition**

Teleports the executor to a certain position (and changes its rotation to the command's execution rotation).

`teleport <targets> <location>`

Teleports the entity(s) to a certain position (without changing their rotation).

`teleport <targets> <location> <rotation>`

`teleport <targets> <location> facing <facingLocation>`

`teleport <targets> <location> facing entity <facingEntity> [<facingAnchor>]`

Teleports the entity(s) to a certain position and changes their rotation to the specified rotation.

-   **Bedrock Edition**

`teleport <destination: target>`

`teleport <victim: target> <destination: target> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]`

Teleports the executor or the specified entity(s) to the position of an entity, and makes it face horizontally, and make its horizontal rotation the same as the specified entity's.

`teleport <destination: x y z> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]`

`teleport <victim: target> <destination: x y z> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]`

Teleports the executor or the specified entity(s) to a certain position (without changing its rotation).

Specifies whether the entity'eyes or feet to make the target(s) facing to. If not specified, defaults to feet. In [*Java Edition*], the anchor of the targets can be changed with `/[execute] anchored`. In [*Bedrock Edition*], always facing the entity's feet from the targets' feet.

Must be either `eyes` or `feet`.

*[BE]*: `checkForBlocks: Boolean`: [enum]

Must be a [Boolean]Boolean (either `true` or `false`).

If set to `true`, teleports the target(s) only if the target(s) would not collide with a block it cannot be inside (Note: this allows teleporting into flowers as well as midair). If `false` or not specified, the default behavior applies (do no check; just teleport the target(s)).

Text component format
=====================

This article is about text component format. For the item components used in [Bedrock Edition], see [Item components]. For the item components used in [Java Edition], see [Data component format].

The **text component format**, historically also known as **raw JSON text**, is used by *Minecraft* to send and display rich-text to players. It can also be sent by players themselves using commands (such as `/[tellraw]` and `/[title]`) and [data packs].

Java Edition
------------

For text component format used in versions before [Java Edition 1.21.5], see [Text component format/Before Java Edition 1.21.5].

Text components are written in [SNBT], for example `{text: "Hello world"}`. They are used for rich-text formatting in [written books], [signs], custom names and the `/[tellraw]`, `/[title]`, `/[bossbar]`, `/[scoreboard]` and `/[team]` commands.

The format is made up of text components. There is a single root component, which can have child components, which can have their own children and so on. Components can also have formatting and interactivity added to them, which is inherited by their children.

A component can be a [String] string, [NBT List / JSON Array] list or a [NBT Compound / JSON Object] object. Strings and lists are both shorthand for longer object structures, as described below.

-   [String] A string containing plain text to display directly. This is the same as an object that only has a [String] text tag. For example, `"A"` and `{text: "A"}` are equivalent.
-   [NBT List / JSON Array] A list of components. Same as having all components after the first one appended to the first's [NBT List / JSON Array] extra list. For example, `["A", "B", "C"]` is equivalent to `{text: "A", extra: ["B", "C"]}`. Note that because the later components are actually children of the first one, any formatting applied to the first component is inherited by the later ones. For example, `[{text: "A", color: "red"}, "B", "C"]` will display all three letters with red text.
-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] A text component object. All non-content tags are optional.
    -   ***Content***
        -   [String] type: Optional. Specifies the content type. One of `["text"]`, `["translatable"]`, `["score"]`, `["selector"]`, `["keybind"]`, or `["nbt"]`.
        -   If [String] type is not present, has an invalid value, or if the required tags for the specified type are not present, the type is determined automatically by checking the object for the following tags: [[String] text], [[String] translate], [[NBT Compound / JSON Object] score], [[String] selector], [[String] keybind], and finally [[String] nbt]. If multiple are present, whichever one comes first in that list is used.
        -   Values specific to each content type are described [below].
    -   ***Children***
        -   [NBT List / JSON Array] extra: A list of additional components to be displayed after this one.
            -   A child text component. Child text components inherit all formatting and interactivity from the parent component, unless they explicitly override them.
    -   ***Formatting***
        -   [String] color: Optional. Changes the color to render the content in the text component object and its child objects. If not present, the parent color will be used instead. The color is specified as a color code or as a color name.
            -   `"#*<hex>*"`, where `*<hex>*` is a [6-digit hexadecimal color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet "wikipedia:Web colors"), changes the color to #*<hex>*
            -   `"black"` changes the color to\
                 #000000
            -   `"dark_blue"` changes the color to\
                 #0000AA
            -   `"dark_green"` changes the color to\
                 #00AA00
            -   `"dark_aqua"` changes the color to\
                 #00AAAA
            -   `"dark_red"` changes the color to\
                 #AA0000
            -   `"dark_purple"` changes the color to\
                 #AA00AA
            -   `"gold"` changes the color to\
                 #FFAA00
            -   `"gray"` changes the color to\
                 #AAAAAA
            -   `"dark_gray"` changes the color to\
                 #555555
            -   `"blue"` changes the color to\
                 #5555FF
            -   `"green"` changes the color to\
                 #55FF55
            -   `"aqua"` changes the color to\
                 #55FFFF
            -   `"red"` changes the color to\
                 #FF5555
            -   `"light_purple"` changes the color to\
                 #FF55FF
            -   `"yellow"` changes the color to\
                 #FFFF55
            -   `"white"` changes the color to\
                 #FFFFFF
        -   [String] font: Optional. The resource location of the [font] for this component in the resource pack within `assets/<namespace>/font`. Defaults to `"minecraft:default"`.
        -   [Boolean] bold: Optional. Whether to render the content in bold.
        -   [Boolean] italic: Optional. Whether to render the content in italics. Note that text that is italicized by default, such as custom item names, can be unitalicized by setting this to `false`.
        -   [Boolean] underlined: Optional. Whether to underline the content.
        -   [Boolean] strikethrough: Optional. Whether to strikethrough the content.
        -   [Boolean] obfuscated: Optional. Whether to render the content obfuscated.
        -   [Int] shadow_color: The color and opacity of the shadow. If omitted, the shadow is 25% the brightness of the text color and 100% the opacity^[*[verify]*]^. Color codes are the ARGB hex code of the color converted to a decimal number, or can be calculated from the opacity, red, green and blue components using this formula:\
            **Alpha[<<](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_shift "wikipedia:Logical shift")24 + Red<<16 + Green<<8 + Blue**
        -   [NBT List / JSON Array] shadow_color: Another format. A list containing 4 floats corresponding to red, green, blue, and opacity values as a fraction (ranged 0 to 1, inclusive) that is automatically converted to the int format.
    -   ***Interactivity***
        -   [String] insertion: Optional. When the text is shift-clicked by a player, this string is inserted in their chat input. It does not overwrite any existing text the player was writing. This only works in chat messages.
        -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event: Optional. Allows for events to occur when the player clicks on text. See [§ Click events].
        -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] hover_event: Optional. Allows for a tooltip to be displayed when the player hovers their mouse over text. See [§ Hover events].

Due to the [NBT List / JSON Array] extra tag, the above format may be recursively nested to produce complex and functional text strings. However, a text component doesn't have to be complicated at all: virtually all properties are optional and may be left out.

### Content types

Text components can display several types of content. These tags should be included directly into the text component object.

#### Plain Text

Displays plain text.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The text component.
    -   [String] type: Optional. Set to `"text"`.
    -   [String] text: A string containing plain text to display directly.

#### Translated Text

Displays a translated piece of text from the currently selected [language]. This uses the client's selected language, so if players with their games set to different languages are logged into the same server, each will see the component in their own language.

Translations are defined in [language files] in [resource packs], including the built-in resource pack.

Translations can contain slots for text that is not known ahead of time, such as player names. When displaying the translated text, slots will be filled from a provided list of text components. The slots are defined in the language file, and generally take the form `%s` (displays the next component in the list), or `%3$s` (displays the third component in the list; replace `3` with whichever index is desired).^[[note 1]]^ For example, the built-in English language file contains the translation `"chat.type.advancement.task": "%s has made the advancement %s",`.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The text component.
    -   [String] type: Optional. Set to `"translatable"`.
    -   [String] translate: A translation identifier, corresponding to the identifiers found in loaded language files. Displayed as the corresponding text in the player's selected language. If no corresponding translation can be found, the identifier itself is used as the translated text.
    -   [String] fallback: Optional. If no corresponding translation can be found, this is used as the translated text. Ignored if [String] translate is not present.
    -   [NBT List / JSON Array] with: Optional. A list of text components to be inserted into slots in the translation text. Ignored if [String] translate is not present.
        -   A text component. If no component is provided for a slot, the slot is displayed as no text.

#### Scoreboard Value

Displays a score from the [scoreboard].

| []Requires [component resolution]. |
| This component is resolved into a [String] text component containing the scoreboard value. |

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The text component.
    -   [String] type: Optional. Set to `"score"`.
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] score: Displays a score holder's current score in an objective. Displays nothing if the given score holder or the given objective do not exist, or if the score holder is not tracked in the objective.
        -   [String] name: The name of the score holder whose score should be displayed. This can be a [selector] like @p or an explicit name. If the text is a selector, the selector must be guaranteed to never select more than one entity, possibly by adding `limit=1`. If the text is `"*"`, it shows the reader's own score (for example, `/tellraw @a {score: {name: "*", objective: "obj"}}` shows every online player their own score in the "obj" objective).^[[note 2]]^
        -   [String] objective: The internal name of the objective to display the player's score in.

#### Entity Names

Displays the name of one or more entities found by a [selector].

If exactly one entity is found, the entity's name is displayed by itself. If more are found, their names are displayed in the form "Name1, Name2, Name3", with gray commas. If none are found, the component is displayed as no text.

Hovering over a name shows a tooltip with the name, type, and [UUID] of the target. Clicking a player's name suggests a command to whisper to that player. Shift-clicking a player's name inserts that name into chat. Shift-clicking a non-player entity's name inserts its UUID into chat.

| []Requires [component resolution]. |
|

-   If the selector finds a single entity,
    -   If the entity is a player, the component is resolved into a [String] text component containing their name.
    -   If it is an entity with a [custom name], it is resolved into the text component of the custom name. In all vanilla survival scenarios ([name tag], [anvil]) this will be a [String] text component.
    -   If it is a non-player entity with no custom name, it is resolved into a [String] translate component containing the translation key for the entity type's name.

The resolved component also has an [String] insertion tag, a [NBT Compound / JSON Object] hover_event tag with the `show_entity` action, and a [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event tag with the `suggest_command` action (if the entity is a player) added to it to provide the functionality described above. If any of these tags are already present on the original component being resolved, the tag on the original component will be used.

-   If more than one entity is found by the selector, the component is resolved into an empty [String] text component, with an [NBT List / JSON Array] extra list containing the individual entity name components (each resolved as in the single entity case) separated by copies of the [Undefined] separator component (or its default, if not present).
-   If no entities are found by the selector, the component is resolved into an empty [String] text component.

 |

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The text component.
    -   [String] type: Optional. Set to `"selector"`.
    -   [String] selector: A string containing a [selector].
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] separator: Optional, defaults to `{color: "gray", text: ", "}`. A text component. Used as the separator between different names, if the component selects multiple entities.

#### Keybind

Displays the name of the button that is currently bound to a certain [configurable control]. This uses the client's own control scheme, so if players with different control schemes are logged into the same server, each will see their own keybind.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The text component.
    -   [String] type: Optional. Set to `"keybind"`.
    -   [String] keybind: A [keybind identifier], to be displayed as the name of the button that is currently bound to that action. For example, `{keybind: "key.inventory"}` displays "e" if the player is using the default control scheme.

#### NBT Values

Displays [NBT] values from [entities], [block entities], or [command storage].

NBT strings display their contents. Other NBT values are displayed as SNBT, with no spacing between symbols. If [Boolean] interpret is set to true, the game will instead attempt to parse and display that text as its own text component. That only works on compounds and lists which contain tags with the proper key names. If [Boolean] interpret is true and parsing fails, the component is displayed as no text, or if it directs to a string, shows the string itself. If more than one NBT value is found, either by selecting multiple entities or by using a multi-value path, they are displayed in order, with the [Undefined] separator value between them.

| []Requires [component resolution]. |
|

-   If [Boolean] interpret is false, the component is resolved into a [String] text component containing the display text.
    -   If multiple values are selected, each value is resolved into an individual [String] text component, and all values after the first will be added to the first's [NBT List / JSON Array] extra list, separated by copies of the [Undefined] separator component.
-   If [Boolean] interpret is true, the component is resolved into the parsed text component. For any non-content tags that are present on both the parsed text component and the component being resolved, the tag on the component being resolved will be used.
    -   If multiple values are selected, all values after the first will be added to the first's [NBT List / JSON Array] extra list, separated by copies of the [Undefined] separator component. This means that all values after the first will inherit the first value's formatting tags, if any.

 |

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The text component.
    -   [String] type: Optional. Set to `"nbt"`.
    -   [String] source: Optional. Allowed values are `"block"`, `"entity"`, and `"storage"`, corresponding to the source of the NBT data.
    -   [String] nbt: The [NBT path] used for looking up NBT values from an entity, block entity, or storage. Requires one of [String] block, [String] entity, or [String] storage. Having more than one is allowed, but only one is used.^[[note 3]]^
    -   [Boolean] interpret: Optional, defaults to false. If true, the game attempts to parse the text of each NBT value as a text component. Ignored if [String] nbt is not present.
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] separator: Optional, defaults to `{text: ", "}`. A text component. Used as the separator between different tags, if the component selects multiple tags.
    -   [String] block: A string specifying the coordinates of the block entity from which the NBT value is obtained. The coordinates can be absolute, [relative], or local. Ignored if [String] nbt is not present.
    -   [String] entity: A string specifying the [target selector] for the entity or entities from which the NBT value is obtained. Ignored if [String] nbt is not present.
    -   [String] storage: A string specifying the [resource location] of the [command storage] from which the NBT value is obtained. Ignored if [String] nbt is not present.

#### Object

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/thumb/Crafting_Table_JE4_BE3.png/16px-Crafting_Table_JE4_BE3.png?5767f)]

This section describes content that is currently in development for *[Java Edition]*.

This content has appeared in development versions for [Java Edition 1.21.9], but the full update adding it has not been released yet.

Displays a single sprite from [texture atlas] as a character. Sprites are rendered as 8x8 pixels squares.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] The text component.
    -   [String] type: Optional. Set to `"object"`.
    -   [String] atlas: Optional. The name of texture atlas. Defaults to `"minecraft:blocks"`.
    -   [String] sprite: The sprite name (for example: `"item/emerald"`).

### Component resolution

Certain text content types ([NBT Compound / JSON Object] score, [String] selector, and [String] nbt) do not work in all contexts. These content types need to be *resolved*, which involves retrieving the appropriate data from the world, rendering it into "simple" text components, and replacing the "advanced" text component with that. This resolution can be done by [signs], by [written books] when they are first opened, by [boss bar] names, by [text displays], and by commands such as [`/tellraw`] and [`/title`]. It can also be done by the [item modifers] **set_name** and **set_lore**, but only if their [String] entity tag is set. Custom item names, custom entity names and [scoreboard] objective names cannot by themselves resolve these components,^[[1]]^ nor can [dialogs].^[[2]]^

Additionally, resolution fixes a single value in place. Therefore, these content types are not dynamic, and don't update to reflect changes in their environment, while "simple" components usually do.

### Click events

Click events control what happens when the player clicks on the text. Can be one of the following:

#### open_url

Opens the specified URL in the user's default web browser.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event
    -   [String] action: `open_url`
    -   [String] url: The URL to open.

#### open_file

Opens the specified file on the user's computer. This is used in messages automatically generated by the game (e.g., on taking a screenshot) and cannot be sent by servers for security reasons.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event
    -   [String] action: `open_file`
    -   [String] path: The file to open.

#### run_command

Runs the specified command. This runs as if the player typed the specified command in chat and pressed enter. However, this can only be used to run commands that do not send chat messages directly (like `/[say]`, `/[tell]`, and `/[teammsg]`). Since they are being run from chat, the player must have the required permissions.

On [signs], the command is run by the server at the sign's location, with the player who used the sign as the command executor (that is, the entity selected by `@s`). Since they are run by the server, sign commands have the same permission level as a [command block] instead of using the player's permission level, and are not restricted by chat length limits.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event
    -   [String] action: `run_command`
    -   [String] command: The command to run. Does not need to be prefixed with a `/` slash.

#### suggest_command

Opens chat and fills in the specified text or command. If a chat message was already being composed, it is overwritten.This does not work in books.^[[3]]^

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event
    -   [String] action: `suggest_command`
    -   [String] command: The command to fill in chat. Also works with normal texts.

#### change_page

Can only be used in written books. Changes to the specified page if that page exists.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event
    -   [String] action: `change_page`
    -   [Int] page: The page to change to.

#### copy_to_clipboard

Copies the specified text to the clipboard.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event
    -   [String] action: `copy_to_clipboard`
    -   [String] value: The text to copy.

#### show_dialog

Opens the specified [dialog].

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event
    -   [String] action: `show_dialog`
    -   [String][NBT Compound / JSON Object] dialog: One [dialog] (an [String] [ID], or a new [NBT Compound / JSON Object] dialog definition) to display.

#### custom

Sends a custom event to the server; has no effect on vanilla servers.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event
    -   [String] action: `custom`
    -   [String] id: Any [ID] to identify the event.
    -   [String] payload: Optional payload of the event.

### Hover events

Hover events control what happens when the player hovers over the text. Can be one of the following:

#### show_text

Shows a text component.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] hover_event
    -   [String] action: `show_text`
    -   [String][NBT List / JSON Array][NBT Compound / JSON Object] value: Another text component. Can be any valid text component type: string, list, or object. Note that [NBT Compound / JSON Object] click_event and [NBT Compound / JSON Object] hover_event do not function within the tooltip.

#### show_item

Shows the tooltip of an item as if it was being hovering over it in an inventory.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] hover_event
    -   [String] action: `show_item`
    -   [String] id: The item's [resource location]. Defaults to `minecraft:air` if invalid.
    -   [Int] count: Optional. Size of the item stack. This typically does not change the content tooltip.
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] components: Optional. Additional information about the item. See [Data component format].

#### show_entity

Shows an entity's name, type, and UUID. Used by [String] selector.

-   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] hover_event
    -   [String] action: `show_entity`
    -   [NBT Compound / JSON Object] name: Optional. Hidden if not present. A text that is displayed as the name of the entity.
    -   [String] id: A string containing the type of the entity, as a [resource location].
    -   [String][Int Array][NBT List / JSON Array] uuid: The [UUID] of the entity. Either:
        -   A string representing the UUID in the hyphenated hexadecimal format. Must be a valid UUID.
        -   A list of four numbers representing the UUID in int-array or list format. e.g. `[I;1,1,1,1]` or `[1,1,1,1]`
Notes
-----

1.  Selecting the "next" argument ignores slots that specify an index explicitly. So if the translation text "Hello %s, %2$s, and %s." was given the components "John" and "Becky", it would display "Hello John, Becky, and Becky."
2.  Showing the reader's own score only works in situations where a message has one singular reader. That is chat messages, [`/title`s], and [written books]. It does not work for [bossbar] display names or blocks like signs.
3.  If [String] source is left unspecified, NBT sources are checked in the order [String] entity, [String] block, [String] storage. If multiple are present, whichever one comes first in that list is used.

Usage
-----

[![](https://minecraft.wiki/images/thumb/Title_command.png/300px-Title_command.png?17e52)]

Example result of the title command.

A screen title is displayed to players as a single line of large center-aligned text in the middle of their displays, and can include a subtitle; a second, separate line of text displayed just below the title. Text can also be printed to the [action bar], the space just above the player's [hotbar].

In [*Java Edition*], all of them are specified using [text components]. In [*Bedrock Edition*], the `/title` command uses plain text while `/titleraw` uses raw JSON text components.

Screen titles can be set to fade in and fade out, and the duration they are displayed can also be specified. Screen titles scale in size with the GUI Scale, and screen titles that are too big to fit on the screen are not line-wrapped (they just overflow off the screen on both sides). Note that the "fadeIn", "stay", and "fadeOut" values of each player are only sent to their own client side rather than stored in the server side. For a client, these values are cross-save and cross-server. These values are reset only when the client restarts, and the default is 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds), 70 game ticks (3.5 seconds), and 20 game ticks (1 second).

In [*Bedrock Edition*], the opacity of the black background of the title can be adjusted with the "Text Background Opacity" option in the [accessibility settings].

Syntax
------

-   **Java Edition**

`title <targets> (clear|reset)`

`title <targets> (title|subtitle|actionbar) <title>`

`title <targets> times <fadeIn> <stay> <fadeOut>`

-   **Bedrock Edition (plain text)**

`title <player: target> <clear|reset>`

`title <player: target> <title|subtitle|actionbar> <titleText: message>`

`title <player: target> times <fadeIn: int> <stay: int> <fadeOut: int>`

-   **Bedrock Edition (JSON)**

`titleraw <player: target> <clear|reset>`

`titleraw <player: target> <titleLocation: TileRawSet> <raw json titleText: json>`

`titleraw <player: target> times <fadeIn: int> <stay: int> <fadeOut: int>`

### Detail

`... clear`

Clears the screen title from the screens of the specified player(s).

`... reset`

Resets the subtitle text for the specified player(s) to blank text, and the fade-in, stay and fade-out times to their default values (defaults to 10 gt, 70 gt, and 20 gt).

`... subtitle ...`

If a screen title is currently being displayed to the specified player(s), changes the current subtitle to the specified text; otherwise, specifies the subtitle for the next screen title to be displayed to the specified player(s).

`... title ...`

Displays a screen title to the specified player(s), or changes the current screen title to the specified text. After fading out, resets the subtitle back to blank text, but does not reset fade-in, stay, and fade-out times.

`... actionbar ...`

Displays text on the action bar to the specified player(s), or changes the current action bar title.

`... times ...`

Changes the fade-in, stay, and fade-out times (measured in time durations) of all current and future screen titles for the specified player(s).

Arguments
---------

*[JE]*: `<targets>`: [entity]\
*[BE]*: `target: target`: [CommandSelector<Player>]

Specifies the player(s) to display a screen title to.

Must be a player name, a [target selector] or a [UUID]‌^[*[Java Edition] only*]^. And the target selector must[JE only]/should[BE only] be of [player type]. In [*Bedrock Edition*], the target selector should be of [player type].

*[JE]*: `<title>`: [component]\
*[BE]*: `titleText: message`: [CommandMessage] or `raw json titleText: json`: [Json::Value]

Specifies the text to display as a title, subtitle, or on the action bar.

In [*Java Edition*], it must be a valid [text component].

In [*Bedrock Edition*],

-   For `titleText: message`, it is a greedy phrase string argument (taking the rest of the command as the string argument). Can include spaces as well as [target selectors]. The game replaces entity selectors in the message with the list of selected entities' names, which is formatted as "name1 and name2" for two entities, or "name1, name2, ... and namen" for n entities.`@<*player name*>` can be used to mention a player; `@here` can be used to mention all players.
-   for `raw json titleText: json`, it must be a [JSON] [NBT Compound / JSON Object]Object.

*[JE]*: `<fadeIn>`: [time], `<stay>`: [time] and `<fadeOut>`: [time]\
*[BE]*: `fadeIn: int`: [int], `stay: int`: [int], and `fadeOut: int`: [int]

Specifies the time for the screen title to fade in, stay, and fade out. In [*Bedrock Edition*], it's specified in [game ticks] (1/20ths of a second), and values below 0 are treated as 0.

In [*Java Edition*], it must be a [single-precision floating-point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_precision_floating-point_format "wikipedia:Single precision floating-point format") suffixed with a unit. It must be not less than 0 gameticks. Units include:

-   `d`: an in-game day, 24000 gameticks;
-   `s`: a second, 20 gameticks;
-   `t` (default and omitable): a single gametick; the default unit.

The time is set to the closest integer after unit conversion to gametick. For example. `.5d` is same as 12000 gameticks.\
In [*Bedrock Edition*] it must be a [Int] 32-bit integer number.
